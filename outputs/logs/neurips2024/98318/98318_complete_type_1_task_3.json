      "hypothesis": "Is there a positive correlation between the number of training timesteps and the fraction of runs achieving a normalized return above a set threshold in the Navigation task?",
      "method": "Run an experiment on the Navigation task in BenchMARL using the standard VMAS environment. Use multiple state\u2010of\u2010the-art multi-agent RL algorithms (e.g., MASAC, MADDPG, MAPPO, etc.) with the default configuration (as detailed in the conf folder and the fine-tuned settings in the vmas folder). At fixed training timestep intervals (e.g., from 0 to 1e7 timesteps), record the fraction of runs that achieve a normalized return above a predetermined threshold. Each algorithm should be run with at least 3 random seeds, and the performance should be tracked over time to generate sample efficiency curves and performance profiles similar to those shown in Figures 2 and 3 of the paper.\n Detailed experiment setup: \nThe experiment involves using the BenchMARL framework on the Navigation task. The following steps outline the design: 1) Set up the Navigation environment from the VMAS tasks as described in the paper. 2) Run multiple algorithms (e.g., MASAC, MADDPG, MAPPO, IQL, QMIX, VDN, etc.) using their multi-agent versions with centralized critics where applicable. 3) Use the default hyperparameter configuration provided in the conf folder and fine-tuned settings in the vmas folder. 4) At regular intervals during training (e.g., at increments up to 1e7 timesteps), evaluate the current policy on the Navigation task and compute the normalized return. 5) Determine the fraction of runs (across at least 3 random seeds for each algorithm) that exceed a set normalized return threshold. 6) Plot these fractions against the number of training timesteps to observe the trend. This experimental design leverages the same metrics and evaluation methods detailed in the paper (e.g., inter-quartile mean (IQM), stratified bootstrap confidence intervals, and normalized return curves as shown in Figures 2 and 3).",
      "expected_outcome": "As the number of timesteps increases, a higher fraction of runs is expected to surpass the threshold, reflecting improved learning stability.",

      "usage_instructions": "1. Run a benchmark with multiple MARL algorithms on the Navigation task with at least 3 random seeds: `python benchmarl/run.py -m algorithm=mappo,maddpg,masac,qmix,vdn,iql task=vmas/navigation seed=0,1,2 experiment.max_n_frames=10000000 experiment.evaluation_interval=120000`. This will train each algorithm on the Navigation task with the default configuration and fine-tuned settings from the vmas folder.\n2. After training completes, use the eval_results.py script to process the results and generate plots: `python benchmarl/eval_results.py` (modify the multirun_folder path to point to your results directory).\n3. Alternatively, you can use the examples/plotting/plot_benchmark.py script as a template, modifying it to include all the algorithms you ran and setting the task to 'navigation'. This will generate performance profiles and sample efficiency curves showing the fraction of runs achieving normalized returns above thresholds at different training timesteps.",
