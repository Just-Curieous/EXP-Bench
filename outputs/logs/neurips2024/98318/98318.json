            "hypothesis": "Does the use of centralized critics in actor-critic methods (e.g., MASAC, MADDPG, MAPPO) yield statistically significant performance gains over Q-learning\u2013based approaches (IQL, VDN, QMIX) on VMAS tasks?",
            "method": "Design an experiment using the VMAS tasks (Navigation, Sampling, and Balance) available in the BenchMARL framework. Implement two groups of multi-agent algorithms: one group using actor-critic methods with centralized critics (MASAC, MADDPG, MAPPO) and one group using Q-learning\u2013based approaches (IQL, VDN, QMIX). Use the default BenchMARL configuration (from the conf folder) and the hyperparameters provided in the finetuned/vmas folder. For each algorithm, run training for 1e7 timesteps and perform at least 3 random seeds per experiment. Collect sample efficiency curves (normalized return vs. timesteps) and performance profiles (fraction of runs with score > threshold, aggregated scores such as the inter-quartile mean with 95% stratified bootstrap confidence intervals) as done in Figures 2 and 3.\n Detailed experiment setup: \nThe experiment should follow these steps: (1) Set up the BenchMARL environment with the three VMAS tasks. (2) For actor-critic methods, use MASAC, MADDPG, and MAPPO, which benefit from centralized critics that condition on global state information. For Q-learning\u2013based algorithms, use IQL, VDN, and QMIX, which rely on discrete action training and local information. (3) Train all algorithms for 1e7 timesteps each using the default experiment configuration and hyperparameters detailed in the provided configuration folders. (4) Record and plot sample efficiency curves and performance profiles (normalized return curves and fraction of successful runs) with appropriate bootstrap confidence intervals (95% CI) as implemented in the paper. (5) Evaluate aggregated scores across tasks, referencing details from Table 1 (algorithm characteristics) and aggregated performance curves from Figures 2 and 3 to compare both groups.",

            "hypothesis": "Does increasing the number of training timesteps beyond 1e7 further improve the normalized return for actor-critic based algorithms?",
            "method": "Replicate the original BenchMARL experiments on the VMAS tasks (Navigation, Sampling, and Balance) using actor-critic algorithms (e.g., MASAC, MADDPG, MAPPO). In this experimental plan, the training protocol will be extended beyond the original 1e7 timesteps (for example, to 2e7 or 5e7 timesteps) while keeping all other settings identical. The same hyperparameter configurations from the BenchMARL 'fine-tuned/vmas' folder and the same centralized critic architecture (which is key to the performance of these actor-critic methods) will be used. Performance will be evaluated by collecting normalized return curves and performance profiles (IQM and median scores) over the same set of tasks and then comparing these curves to the original results (as seen in Figures 2 and 3).\n Detailed experiment setup: \nDatasets/Environments: Use the VMAS tasks available in BenchMARL (Navigation, Sampling, Balance). Models: Apply actor-critic based algorithms such as MASAC, MADDPG, and MAPPO, whose details and hyperparameters are provided in Tables 1 and 2. Configurations: Run training with an increased number of timesteps (e.g., extend from 1e7 to 2e7/5e7 timesteps). Evaluation will use sample efficiency curves and aggregated performance profiles, reported as normalized returns along with inter-quartile means (IQM) and median scores with 95% stratified bootstrap confidence intervals over multiple random seeds. Software and implementations are available in the BenchMARL repository, and the interactive results reporting framework (e.g., WandB) can be used to monitor progress.",

            "method": "Design an experiment comparing Q-learning algorithms with tuned hyperparameters to actor-critic methods on continuous multi-robot control tasks available in BenchMARL.\n Detailed experiment setup: \nUse the BenchMARL environments (e.g., Navigation, Sampling, and Balance tasks as shown in Figures 2 and 3) and focus on Q-learning based algorithms such as IQL, VDN, and QMIX (as outlined in Table 1). The experiment would involve: (a) selecting the discrete-action Q-learning algorithms and ensuring the tasks are kept the same, (b) performing extensive hyperparameter tuning on key parameters (learning rate, discount factor, exploration strategies, etc.) to better adapt these algorithms to continuous multi-robot control, (c) training each algorithm over a fixed number of timesteps (e.g., 1e7 as depicted in the figures), and (d) evaluating performance using normalized return curves and performance profiles (similar to the metrics shown in Figures 2 and 3). Multiple runs with different random seeds (e.g., three seeds as in the paper) should be conducted to obtain statistically robust results.",

            "hypothesis": "Is there a positive correlation between the number of training timesteps and the fraction of runs achieving a normalized return above a set threshold in the Navigation task?",
            "method": "Run an experiment on the Navigation task in BenchMARL using the standard VMAS environment. Use multiple state\u2010of\u2010the-art multi-agent RL algorithms (e.g., MASAC, MADDPG, MAPPO, etc.) with the default configuration (as detailed in the conf folder and the fine-tuned settings in the vmas folder). At fixed training timestep intervals (e.g., from 0 to 1e7 timesteps), record the fraction of runs that achieve a normalized return above a predetermined threshold. Each algorithm should be run with at least 3 random seeds, and the performance should be tracked over time to generate sample efficiency curves and performance profiles similar to those shown in Figures 2 and 3 of the paper.\n Detailed experiment setup: \nThe experiment involves using the BenchMARL framework on the Navigation task. The following steps outline the design: 1) Set up the Navigation environment from the VMAS tasks as described in the paper. 2) Run multiple algorithms (e.g., MASAC, MADDPG, MAPPO, IQL, QMIX, VDN, etc.) using their multi-agent versions with centralized critics where applicable. 3) Use the default hyperparameter configuration provided in the conf folder and fine-tuned settings in the vmas folder. 4) At regular intervals during training (e.g., at increments up to 1e7 timesteps), evaluate the current policy on the Navigation task and compute the normalized return. 5) Determine the fraction of runs (across at least 3 random seeds for each algorithm) that exceed a set normalized return threshold. 6) Plot these fractions against the number of training timesteps to observe the trend. This experimental design leverages the same metrics and evaluation methods detailed in the paper (e.g., inter-quartile mean (IQM), stratified bootstrap confidence intervals, and normalized return curves as shown in Figures 2 and 3).",

            "hypothesis": "Will incorporating reward shaping techniques boost the normalized return and sample efficiency of multi-agent algorithms, particularly in complex tasks like Balance?",
            "method": "We propose to modify the Balance task in BenchMARL by incorporating reward shaping into the reward function. The experiment will compare a baseline version (using the default BenchMARL reward) to a reward-shaped version that provides additional intermediate rewards to encourage desirable behaviors (e.g., stability and balance maintenance) during training. Both setups will use the default BenchMARL configuration and hyperparameters (from the finetuned/vmas folder) and will be run on established multi-agent algorithms.\n Detailed experiment setup: \nThe high-level plan is as follows: (1) Select the Balance task from the VMAS environments available in BenchMARL. (2) For each algorithm (e.g., MASAC, MADDPG, MAPPO, IQL, QMIX, VDN, etc. as detailed in Table 1 and Table 2), create two experimental groups: one with the standard reward (baseline) and one with an augmented reward that incorporates shaping signals (such as intermediate rewards indicating partial balance or stability improvements). (3) Use the same experiment budget (1e7 timesteps) and perform 3 random seeds for each setting. (4) Record the normalized return curves and sample efficiency curves (similar to those in Figure 3 parts (e) and (f)) as well as performance profiles (as in Figure 2(b)). (5) Compare the inter-quartile mean (IQM) and other aggregate metrics over runs to assess the impact of reward shaping on both sample efficiency (faster learning) and final normalized return performance.",
