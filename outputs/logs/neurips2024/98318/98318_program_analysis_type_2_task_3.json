  "agent_instructions": "Your task is to create a script that analyzes how changing the number of agents in the VMAS/balance task affects the performance of the MAPPO algorithm. Follow these steps:\n\n1. Import the necessary modules from benchmarl (Benchmark, ExperimentConfig, MappoConfig, VmasTask, MlpConfig).\n\n2. Create multiple configurations of the VMAS/balance task with different numbers of agents:\n   - Load the base configuration for the balance task\n   - Create variations with 2, 4, and 6 agents\n\n3. Set up the MAPPO algorithm configuration.\n\n4. Configure the experiment parameters:\n   - Set max_n_frames to 12000\n   - Disable loggers (for cleaner output)\n   - Disable rendering\n\n5. Set up the model configurations for both actor and critic using MLP configurations.\n\n6. Create a Benchmark object that includes:\n   - The MAPPO algorithm configuration\n   - The different task configurations with varying numbers of agents\n   - A seed value for reproducibility\n   - The model configurations\n\n7. Run the benchmark sequentially to execute all experiments.\n\n8. The output should allow you to compare the mean returns achieved by MAPPO on the VMAS/balance task with different numbers of agents, showing how the task difficulty scales with the number of agents."
