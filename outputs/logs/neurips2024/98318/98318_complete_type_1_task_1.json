      "hypothesis": "Does increasing the number of training timesteps beyond 1e7 further improve the normalized return for actor-critic based algorithms?",
      "method": "Replicate the original BenchMARL experiments on the VMAS tasks (Navigation, Sampling, and Balance) using actor-critic algorithms (e.g., MASAC, MADDPG, MAPPO). In this experimental plan, the training protocol will be extended beyond the original 1e7 timesteps (for example, to 2e7 or 5e7 timesteps) while keeping all other settings identical. The same hyperparameter configurations from the BenchMARL 'fine-tuned/vmas' folder and the same centralized critic architecture (which is key to the performance of these actor-critic methods) will be used. Performance will be evaluated by collecting normalized return curves and performance profiles (IQM and median scores) over the same set of tasks and then comparing these curves to the original results (as seen in Figures 2 and 3).\n Detailed experiment setup: \nDatasets/Environments: Use the VMAS tasks available in BenchMARL (Navigation, Sampling, Balance). Models: Apply actor-critic based algorithms such as MASAC, MADDPG, and MAPPO, whose details and hyperparameters are provided in Tables 1 and 2. Configurations: Run training with an increased number of timesteps (e.g., extend from 1e7 to 2e7/5e7 timesteps). Evaluation will use sample efficiency curves and aggregated performance profiles, reported as normalized returns along with inter-quartile means (IQM) and median scores with 95% stratified bootstrap confidence intervals over multiple random seeds. Software and implementations are available in the BenchMARL repository, and the interactive results reporting framework (e.g., WandB) can be used to monitor progress.",
      "expected_outcome": "A performance improvement is expected with more timesteps up to convergence, with diminishing returns after a certain point.",

      "usage_instructions": "To test whether increasing the number of training timesteps beyond 1e7 further improves the normalized return for actor-critic based algorithms on VMAS tasks, run the following command:\n\npython benchmarl/run.py -m algorithm=mappo,maddpg,masac task=vmas/balance,vmas/sampling,vmas/navigation experiment.max_n_frames=20000000 seed=0,1,2,3,4\n\nThis command will run the three actor-critic algorithms (MAPPO, MADDPG, MASAC) on the three VMAS tasks (Balance, Sampling, Navigation) with 5 different random seeds, extending the training to 2e7 timesteps (double the original 1e7 timesteps used in the fine-tuned VMAS configuration). The results can be compared with the original BenchMARL experiments to determine if increasing the number of training timesteps beyond 1e7 further improves the normalized return.\n\nTo run with even more timesteps (e.g., 5e7), simply modify the max_n_frames parameter:\n\npython benchmarl/run.py -m algorithm=mappo,maddpg,masac task=vmas/balance,vmas/sampling,vmas/navigation experiment.max_n_frames=50000000 seed=0,1,2,3,4\n\nAfter running the experiments, you can use the evaluation and plotting tools provided by BenchMARL to analyze the results:\n\n1. The normalized return curves will be automatically generated and can be viewed through the configured loggers (e.g., WandB).\n2. To generate performance profiles and compare with the original results, you can use the plotting functionality in BenchMARL's eval_results.py.",

Support running multiple experiments with different configurations using Hydra's multirun feature\n4. Load experiment configurations from Hydra and create experiment objects\n5.
