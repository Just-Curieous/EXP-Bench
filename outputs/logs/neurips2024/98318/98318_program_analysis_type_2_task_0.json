  "agent_instructions": "Your task is to create a script that compares the performance of MAPPO and QMIX algorithms on the VMAS/balance task. Follow these steps:\n\n1. Import the necessary modules from benchmarl, including Benchmark, ExperimentConfig, MappoConfig, QmixConfig, VmasTask, and MlpConfig.\n\n2. Set up the experiment configuration by loading the base configuration from YAML.\n\n3. Configure the VMAS/balance task by loading its configuration from YAML.\n\n4. Set up the algorithm configurations for both MAPPO and QMIX by loading their respective configurations from YAML.\n\n5. Create model configurations for both actor and critic networks using MLP architecture.\n\n6. Configure the experiment parameters:\n   - Set max_n_frames to 12000 for a quick benchmark\n   - Disable loggers to avoid unnecessary output\n   - Disable rendering\n\n7. Create a Benchmark object with:\n   - The algorithm configurations (MAPPO and QMIX)\n   - The VMAS/balance task\n   - A seed value for reproducibility\n   - The experiment configuration\n   - The model configurations\n\n8. Run the benchmark sequentially and analyze the results to compare the performance of MAPPO and QMIX on the VMAS/balance task.\n\nThe expected outcome is that MAPPO will achieve a better mean return (around -6.5) compared to QMIX (around -8.7) on this task."
