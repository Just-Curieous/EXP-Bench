    "no_answer": "After thoroughly exploring the repository, I did not find a specific script or set of scripts that directly answers the experiment question about incorporating reward shaping techniques into the Balance task in BenchMARL. While the repository provides a framework for running experiments with different algorithms on the Balance task (e.g., /workspace/benchmarl/run.py with task=vmas/balance), and examples for extending tasks (/workspace/examples/extending/task/), there is no pre-existing implementation that specifically compares a baseline version with a reward-shaped version of the Balance task. Creating such an experiment would require extending the environment to implement a custom version of the Balance task with reward shaping, following the extension examples provided in the repository."
