  "agent_instructions": "Your task is to create a script that compares the performance of the MAPPO algorithm on two different VMAS environments: balance and sampling. Follow these steps:\n\n1. Import the necessary modules from benchmarl: Benchmark, ExperimentConfig, MappoConfig, VmasTask, and MlpConfig.\n\n2. Load the base experiment configuration using ExperimentConfig.get_from_yaml().\n\n3. Set up both VMAS tasks using VmasTask.BALANCE.get_from_yaml() and VmasTask.SAMPLING.get_from_yaml().\n\n4. Create the algorithm configuration for MAPPO using MappoConfig.get_from_yaml().\n\n5. Set up the model configurations for both actor and critic using MlpConfig.get_from_yaml().\n\n6. Configure the experiment parameters:\n   - Set max_n_frames to 12000 (to limit training time)\n   - Disable loggers by setting loggers to an empty list\n   - Disable rendering by setting render to False\n\n7. Create a Benchmark object with:\n   - The MAPPO algorithm configuration\n   - Both VMAS tasks (balance and sampling)\n   - A seed value (e.g., 0)\n   - The model configurations for actor and critic\n\n8. Run the benchmark sequentially using benchmark.run_sequential().\n\n9. After the benchmark completes, compare the mean returns achieved on each task to analyze how the MAPPO algorithm performs differently on the two environments. Based on previous runs, you should expect MAPPO to achieve around -6.5 on VMAS/balance and around 4.3 on VMAS/sampling, indicating better performance on the sampling task."
