      "hypothesis": "Does the use of centralized critics in actor-critic methods (e.g., MASAC, MADDPG, MAPPO) yield statistically significant performance gains over Q-learning\u2013based approaches (IQL, VDN, QMIX) on VMAS tasks?",
      "method": "Design an experiment using the VMAS tasks (Navigation, Sampling, and Balance) available in the BenchMARL framework. Implement two groups of multi-agent algorithms: one group using actor-critic methods with centralized critics (MASAC, MADDPG, MAPPO) and one group using Q-learning\u2013based approaches (IQL, VDN, QMIX). Use the default BenchMARL configuration (from the conf folder) and the hyperparameters provided in the finetuned/vmas folder. For each algorithm, run training for 1e7 timesteps and perform at least 3 random seeds per experiment. Collect sample efficiency curves (normalized return vs. timesteps) and performance profiles (fraction of runs with score > threshold, aggregated scores such as the inter-quartile mean with 95% stratified bootstrap confidence intervals) as done in Figures 2 and 3.\n Detailed experiment setup: \nThe experiment should follow these steps: (1) Set up the BenchMARL environment with the three VMAS tasks. (2) For actor-critic methods, use MASAC, MADDPG, and MAPPO, which benefit from centralized critics that condition on global state information. For Q-learning\u2013based algorithms, use IQL, VDN, and QMIX, which rely on discrete action training and local information. (3) Train all algorithms for 1e7 timesteps each using the default experiment configuration and hyperparameters detailed in the provided configuration folders. (4) Record and plot sample efficiency curves and performance profiles (normalized return curves and fraction of successful runs) with appropriate bootstrap confidence intervals (95% CI) as implemented in the paper. (5) Evaluate aggregated scores across tasks, referencing details from Table 1 (algorithm characteristics) and aggregated performance curves from Figures 2 and 3 to compare both groups.",
      "expected_outcome": "Centralized critic methods are expected to have higher normalized returns and better sample efficiency, as evidenced by the aggregated results in Fig. 2.",

      "usage_instructions": "1. Run the experiment using the fine-tuned VMAS configuration with the following command: `python fine_tuned/vmas/vmas_run.py -m algorithm=masac,maddpg,mappo,iql,vdn,qmix task=vmas/navigation,vmas/sampling,vmas/balance seed=0,1,2 experiment.max_n_frames=10000000`. This will run all the required algorithms (actor-critic methods with centralized critics: MASAC, MADDPG, MAPPO and Q-learning-based approaches: IQL, VDN, QMIX) on the three VMAS tasks (Navigation, Sampling, and Balance) with 3 random seeds each for 1e7 timesteps as specified in the experiment question. The fine-tuned hyperparameters from the /workspace/fine_tuned/vmas/conf/config.yaml will be used automatically. 2. After the experiments are complete, use the plotting script to generate the sample efficiency curves and performance profiles: `python examples/plotting/plot_benchmark.py` (you'll need to modify the script to load your experiment results by updating the experiments_json_files list with the paths to your experiment JSON files).",

      "agent_instructions": "You need to create two Python scripts for running and analyzing multi-agent reinforcement learning experiments using the BenchMARL framework:\n\n1. First, create an experiment runner script that:\n   - Uses Hydra for configuration management\n   - Accepts command-line arguments for algorithms (MASAC, MADDPG, MAPPO, IQL, VDN, QMIX), tasks (VMAS/Navigation, VMAS/Sampling, VMAS/Balance), and seeds (0,1,2)\n   - Loads experiment configurations from a YAML file\n   - Creates and runs an Experiment object with the specified configuration\n   - The script should be designed to run with a command like: `python script_name.py -m algorithm=masac,maddpg,mappo,iql,vdn,qmix task=vmas/navigation,vmas/sampling,vmas/balance seed=0,1,2 experiment.max_n_frames=10000000`\n\n2. Second, create a plotting script that:\n   - Loads experiment results from JSON files generated by the experiment runner\n   - Processes the data for visualization\n   - Creates matrices for environment comparison and sample efficiency analysis\n   - Generates multiple visualization types including:\n     * Performance profile figures\n     * Aggregate scores\n     * Sample efficiency curves (both environment-level and task-level)\n     * Probability of improvement between algorithms\n   - Displays all generated plots\n\nBoth scripts should work with the BenchMARL library, which provides classes like Experiment, Benchmark, Plotting, and various algorithm configurations (MappoConfig, QmixConfig, etc.). The experiment results should be saved as JSON files that can be loaded and analyzed by the plotting script.",
