      "hypothesis": "Will tuning hyperparameters for discrete action settings in Q-learning algorithms improve their performance on continuous multi-robot control tasks?",
      "method": "Design an experiment comparing Q-learning algorithms with tuned hyperparameters to actor-critic methods on continuous multi-robot control tasks available in BenchMARL.\n Detailed experiment setup: \nUse the BenchMARL environments (e.g., Navigation, Sampling, and Balance tasks as shown in Figures 2 and 3) and focus on Q-learning based algorithms such as IQL, VDN, and QMIX (as outlined in Table 1). The experiment would involve: (a) selecting the discrete-action Q-learning algorithms and ensuring the tasks are kept the same, (b) performing extensive hyperparameter tuning on key parameters (learning rate, discount factor, exploration strategies, etc.) to better adapt these algorithms to continuous multi-robot control, (c) training each algorithm over a fixed number of timesteps (e.g., 1e7 as depicted in the figures), and (d) evaluating performance using normalized return curves and performance profiles (similar to the metrics shown in Figures 2 and 3). Multiple runs with different random seeds (e.g., three seeds as in the paper) should be conducted to obtain statistically robust results.",

      "usage_instructions": "1. First, modify the sweepconfig.yaml file to include the hyperparameters you want to tune for Q-learning algorithms (IQL, VDN, QMIX). Key hyperparameters to tune include:\n   - experiment.lr (learning rate)\n   - experiment.gamma (discount factor)\n   - experiment.exploration_eps_init and experiment.exploration_eps_end (exploration strategy)\n   - experiment.off_policy_train_batch_size (batch size)\n   - algorithm.loss_function (loss function type)\n   - algorithm.mixing_embed_dim (for QMIX only)\n\n2. Run the hyperparameter sweep using Weights & Biases:\n   ```bash\n   wandb sweep /workspace/examples/sweep/wandb/sweepconfig.yaml\n   wandb agent <sweep_id>\n   ```\n\n3. Compare the performance of tuned Q-learning algorithms with actor-critic methods by running:\n   ```bash\n   python benchmarl/run.py -m algorithm=iql,vdn,qmix,mappo,masac task=vmas/navigation,vmas/sampling,vmas/balance seed=0,1,2\n   ```\n\nThis will run the specified algorithms on the continuous multi-robot control tasks from BenchMARL with multiple seeds, allowing you to compare the performance of Q-learning algorithms with tuned hyperparameters against actor-critic methods.",
