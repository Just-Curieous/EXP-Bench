    "no_answer": "After a comprehensive search of the repository, I couldn't find a specific script or set of scripts that directly answers the question about the optimal ratio between core and universal experts for CIFAR-100 accuracy. While the repository contains the necessary components (MoE model implementation in moejet/models/soft_moe.py, CIFAR-100 dataset configuration in moejet/configs/_base_/datasets/cifar100_bs16.py, and training scripts in tools/), there is no ready-made experiment script that evaluates different core expert ratios (5/6, 2/3, 1/2, 1/3, 1/6) on CIFAR-100 to determine which achieves the highest accuracy. To answer this question, one would need to create multiple configuration files with different core/universal expert ratios and run separate training jobs, which would require significant code modifications beyond what's available in the repository."
