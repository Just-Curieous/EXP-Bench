    "no_answer": "After thoroughly exploring the repository, I couldn't find a specific script or set of scripts that directly answer the experiment question about comparing MoE Jetpack performance with Dense(21k) and Soft MoE on ImageNet-1K using ConvNeXt-F architectures. The repository contains implementations of MoE Jetpack, but the examples and configurations are primarily focused on ViT models rather than ConvNeXt-F models. While there are ConvNeXt implementations in the repository, I couldn't find specific scripts that set up the comparison experiment described in the question. The repository has tools for training and evaluating models (/workspace/tools/train.py and /workspace/tools/test.py), as well as checkpoint recycling functionality (/workspace/moejet/tools/checkpoint_recycling_simplified.py), but these would need to be configured specifically for the ConvNeXt-F architecture and the comparison experiment."
