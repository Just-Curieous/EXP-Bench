    "no_answer": "After thoroughly searching the repository, I couldn't find a specific script or set of scripts that directly answer the experiment question about comparing different JetMoE configurations (MoE layers from layer 11 to 12, from 9 to 12, from 7 to 12, and from 5 to 12) on the CIFAR-100 dataset. The repository contains configuration files for JetMoE with specific MoE layer configurations (e.g., layers 6-11 in vit_tiny_dual_moe_timm_21k_ft.py) and a CIFAR-100 dataset configuration (cifar100_bs16.py), but there's no script that specifically runs the experiment with the four different MoE layer configurations mentioned in the question. While it would be possible to modify the existing configuration files to run this experiment, there isn't a ready-made script that directly answers the question."
