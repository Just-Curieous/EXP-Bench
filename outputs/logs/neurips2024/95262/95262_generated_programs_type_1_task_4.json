    "no_answer": "While the repository contains the implementation of dual-path SpheroMoE structure in the MoE Jetpack framework, there is no single script or small set of scripts that directly answers the experiment question comparing dual-path vs single-path SpheroMoE structures. The repository has a configuration file for the dual-path structure (/workspace/moejet/configs/timm/vit_tiny_dual_moe_timm_21k_ft.py) and a script to generate MoE weights (/workspace/moejet/tools/gen_ViT_MoE_weight.py), but lacks a corresponding single-path configuration for direct comparison. Running this experiment would require creating a modified configuration file for the single-path structure and running both configurations separately, which goes beyond minimal modifications to existing scripts."
