First, initialize the MoE weights using checkpoint recycling:\n   ```bash\n   python moejet/tools/gen_ViT_MoE_weight.py\n   ```\n   This script transforms dense checkpoints into MoE model weights with SpheroMoE layers.\n\n2. Train the MoE Jetpack model (with checkpoint recycling) on ImageNet-1K:\n   ```bash\n   CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1,2,3 PORT=29500 ./tools/dist_train.sh moejet/configs/timm/vit_tiny_dual_moe_timm_21k_ft.py 4\n   ```\n\n3.

For CIFAR-100 experiments, modify the dataset configuration in both config files by changing the base dataset from:\n   ```python\n   _base_ = [\n       '../_base_/datasets/imagenet_bs64_swin_224.py',\n       '../_base_/default_runtime.py'\n   ]\n   ```\n   to:\n   ```python\n   _base_ = [\n       '../_base_/datasets/cifar100_bs16.py',\n       '../_base_/default_runtime.py'\n   ]\n   ```\n   And update the hyperparameters in the config files to match those specified in the experiment (batch size=512, warmup epochs=50, training epochs=300, drop path rate=0.1).\n\n5. Monitor the training logs to determine the number of epochs required for each model to reach the target accuracies (77% for ImageNet-1K, 76% for CIFAR-100).\n\nThe experiment will demonstrate that the MoE Jetpack-enabled model requires roughly half the number of epochs on ImageNet-1K and one-eighth the number of epochs on CIFAR-100 compared to the baseline model trained from scratch.",

      "agent_instructions": "Your task is to implement a system for evaluating the convergence speed of MoE (Mixture of Experts) models with checkpoint recycling compared to training from scratch. The system should:\n\n1. Create a weight generation script that transforms dense Vision Transformer (ViT) checkpoints into MoE model weights with SpheroMoE layers. This script should:\n   - Load a pre-trained ViT model\n   - Analyze neuron activation patterns to determine which neurons should be assigned to which experts\n   - Support multiple selection strategies (random, uniform, L1/L2 norm-based, activation pattern-based)\n   - Transform the weights into a dual-path MoE architecture with core experts and universal experts\n   - Save the transformed weights as a checkpoint\n\n2. Create configuration files for two experimental setups:\n   - A MoE model that uses checkpoint recycling (initialized from transformed weights)\n   - A baseline MoE model trained from scratch\n   - Both configurations should use the same architecture: a ViT-Tiny with dual-path MoE layers in the later transformer blocks\n\n3. The configurations should support:\n   - Distributed training across multiple GPUs\n   - Proper learning rate scheduling with warmup\n   - Mixed precision training\n   - Data augmentation techniques like Mixup and CutMix\n   - Evaluation at regular intervals\n\n4. The system should be flexible enough to work with different datasets (ImageNet-1K and CIFAR-100) by changing the base configuration.\n\nThe goal is to demonstrate that MoE models initialized with checkpoint recycling converge significantly faster than those trained from scratch, while achieving the same target accuracy.\n",
