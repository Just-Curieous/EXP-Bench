    "no_answer": "While the repository contains all the necessary components to run the experiment comparing ViT-T baseline, Soft MoE without Checkpoint Recycling, and Soft MoE with Checkpoint Recycling across ImageNet-1K, CIFAR-100, and Flowers datasets, there is no single script or small set of scripts that directly answers this experiment question. The repository provides configuration files for the models (including vit_tiny_dual_moe_timm_21k_ft.py for Soft MoE with Checkpoint Recycling and vit_tiny_dual_moe_timm_scratch.py for Soft MoE without Checkpoint Recycling), dataset configurations for all three required datasets, and scripts for training, testing, and checkpoint recycling. However, running the complete experiment would require executing multiple commands in sequence, potentially modifying configuration files, and manually comparing the results across datasets, rather than having a dedicated script that performs the entire experiment and calculates the mean accuracy improvement."
