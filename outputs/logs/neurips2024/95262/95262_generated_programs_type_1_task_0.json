    "no_answer": "After thoroughly exploring the repository, I could not find a specific script or set of scripts that directly answer the experiment question about comparing MoE Jetpack with Dense (21k) and Soft MoE on CIFAR-10 using ViT-T architectures. While the repository contains the necessary components (MoE Jetpack implementation, Soft MoE models, CIFAR-10 dataset configurations, and ViT models), there is no ready-made script that performs this specific comparison. The repository has configurations for training MoE Jetpack models on ImageNet (vit_tiny_dual_moe_timm_21k_ft.py and vit_tiny_dual_moe_timm_scratch.py) and CIFAR-10 dataset configurations (cifar10_bs16.py), but no script that combines these specifically for the three-way comparison on CIFAR-10. A user would need to create custom configurations and scripts to run this specific experiment."
