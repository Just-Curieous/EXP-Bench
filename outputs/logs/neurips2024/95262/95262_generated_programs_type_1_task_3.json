    "no_answer": "After thoroughly exploring the repository, I couldn't find a single script or a small set of scripts that directly answer the experiment question about comparing MoE Jetpack architecture across different backbone models (ViT-T and ConvNeXt-F) on multiple datasets. The repository contains the necessary components to conduct this experiment (MoE Jetpack implementation, dataset configurations for all required datasets, training and testing scripts), but there isn't an automated workflow that runs the complete experiment across all model variants and datasets. The experiment would need to be conducted by manually running the training and testing scripts for each combination of model variant and dataset, which requires significant manual intervention and doesn't meet the criteria of having 'a single script, or 2-3 scripts at most that collectively answer this question exactly'."
