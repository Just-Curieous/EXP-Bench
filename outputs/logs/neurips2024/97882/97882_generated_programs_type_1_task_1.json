    "usage_instructions": "To analyze whether the loss in the turbulent_radiative_layer_2D simulation is predominantly concentrated in the pressure field, run the following command:\n\ncd /workspace/the_well/benchmark\npython train.py experiment=fno server=local data=turbulent_radiative_layer_2D validation_mode=True\n\nThis will run the model in validation mode on the turbulent_radiative_layer_2D dataset. The script will automatically compute field-specific errors (including VRMSE) for each physical field (pressure, density, velocity) and log them separately. The results will show the error metrics broken down by field, allowing you to compare the loss values between the pressure field and other fields. The validation_mode=True flag ensures that the script only evaluates the model without training it.\n\nThe output will include per-field metrics that show whether the pressure field has significantly higher error compared to other fields. Look for metrics like 'turbulent_radiative_layer_2D/P_VRMSE_T=all' (for pressure) vs 'turbulent_radiative_layer_2D/rho_VRMSE_T=all' (for density) in the logs to compare the error values across different physical fields."
