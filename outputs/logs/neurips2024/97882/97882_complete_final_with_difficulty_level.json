            "question": "Does the apparent one-step prediction advantage of CNextU-net persist over longer prediction horizons compared to other architectures?",
            "method": "Use the turbulent_radiative_layer_2D simulation dataset available from The Well to perform both one-step and long-horizon autoregressive predictions. For one-step evaluation, use a sliding window sampled directly from the ground truth and compute the VRMSE for each model (including CNextU-net, original U-net, and other baseline architectures). Then, initiate longer rollouts from the beginning of the simulation and evaluate the prediction performance over multiple time windows. Ensure that hyperparameters (using default settings in your experimental configuration), data splits, and evaluation metrics (such as per-field VRMSE) remain consistent across experiments to compare performance discrepancies between the one-step setting and the multi-step horizon across the models.",
            "expected_outcome": "It is expected that while CNextU-net shows a sizable advantage in one-step predictions, this benefit quickly dissipates over longer horizons, resulting in performance levels that are largely interchangeable among most models, with the original U-net showing a distinct behavior.",

First, run the one-step prediction evaluation for CNextU-net on the turbulent_radiative_layer_2D dataset:\n   ```\n   cd /workspace/the_well/benchmark\n   python train.py experiment=unet_convnext data=turbulent_radiative_layer_2D server=local\n   ```\n\n2. Then, run the one-step prediction evaluation for the original U-net on the same dataset:\n   ```\n   python train.py experiment=unet_classic data=turbulent_radiative_layer_2D server=local\n   ```\n\n3. Optionally, run evaluations for other baseline architectures (e.g., FNO, AFNO, etc.) using similar commands:\n   ```\n   python train.py experiment=fno data=turbulent_radiative_layer_2D server=local\n   ```\n\nThe training script automatically performs both one-step and long-horizon autoregressive predictions through its validation loop. The `rollout_model` method in the Trainer class performs autoregressive predictions for multiple timesteps, and the metrics (including VRMSE) are computed for both one-step and multi-step horizons. The results are logged to wandb and can be visualized to compare the performance discrepancies between one-step and multi-step predictions across different models.\n\nNote: You may need to adjust the `well_base_path` in the data configuration file (/workspace/the_well/benchmark/configs/data/turbulent_radiative_layer_2D.yaml) to point to the correct location of the dataset. The default trainer configuration already sets `max_rollout_steps` to 100, which should be sufficient for long-horizon evaluation.",
