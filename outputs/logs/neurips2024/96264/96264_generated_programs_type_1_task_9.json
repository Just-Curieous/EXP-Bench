    "no_answer": "After a thorough search of the repository, I couldn't find any scripts or code that specifically address the experiment question about the reasoning time distribution across the core components of the BoT framework. The repository contains the implementation of the BoT framework (bot_pipeline.py) with its core components (Problem Distiller, Meta-Buffer, Reasoner, Buffer Manager), but it doesn't include any profiling or timing analysis code that would measure and visualize the time distribution across these components as described in the experiment question. There are no scripts that would produce the expected outcome showing the average time distribution percentages for each component (Problem Distiller: 15.6%, Meta-Buffer: 8.9%, Reasoner: 52.7%, Buffer Manager: 21.3%) or generate a pie chart as mentioned in Figure 5."
