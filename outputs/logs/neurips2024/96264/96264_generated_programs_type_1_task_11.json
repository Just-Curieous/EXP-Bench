    "no_answer": "After thoroughly examining the repository, I couldn't find any specific script or set of scripts that directly answers the experiment question about comparing BoT with and without buffer-manager across 4 rounds. While the repository contains implementations of the BoT framework, meta-buffer, and buffer-manager components (in bot_pipeline.py and meta_buffer.py), it doesn't include scripts specifically designed to run the experiment described in the question that would divide evaluation into 4 rounds, compare configurations with and without buffer-manager, sample 50 questions per benchmark across 4 benchmarks, and track accuracy improvements across rounds. The existing scripts (run_benchmarks.py and validate_results.py) support running and validating benchmarks but don't implement the specific experimental setup described in the question."
