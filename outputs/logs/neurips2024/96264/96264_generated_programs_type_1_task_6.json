    "no_answer": "After thoroughly exploring the repository, I couldn't find any scripts specifically designed to measure and compare inference time between Buffer of Thoughts (BoT) and conventional single-query reasoning methods (Expert and PAL) across the benchmarks mentioned. The repository contains scripts for running benchmarks (run_benchmarks.py), validating results (validate_results.py), and implementing the BoT framework (bot_pipeline.py), but none of these scripts include functionality to measure inference time or latency. There are no timing measurements, logging of execution times, or comparison of inference latency between different methods in the codebase."
