    "no_answer": "After thoroughly exploring the repository, I couldn't find any scripts that specifically measure and compare inference time between Buffer of Thoughts (BoT) and other methods like Tree of Thoughts (ToT) and Meta Prompting. The repository contains code for running the BoT framework on various benchmarks (run_benchmarks.py) and validating results (validate_results.py), but it doesn't include timing measurement functionality or comparison with other methods in terms of inference latency. While the README mentions that BoT requires only 12% of the cost of multi-query prompting methods, the repository doesn't provide scripts to reproduce the inference time experiments shown in Figure 3 of the paper."
