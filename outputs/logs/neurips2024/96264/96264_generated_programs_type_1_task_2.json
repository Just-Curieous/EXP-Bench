    "no_answer": "After thoroughly examining the repository, I couldn't find any script or combination of scripts that directly answers the experiment question about the meta-buffer's contribution to BoT's reasoning performance. While the repository includes code for running BoT with the meta-buffer enabled (run_benchmarks.py, bot_pipeline.py, meta_buffer.py), there's no straightforward way to disable the meta-buffer for comparison. The README mentions the experiment results showing performance degradation when the meta-buffer is disabled (as shown in Figure 9), but the actual code to reproduce this experiment doesn't seem to be included in the repository. There are no command-line arguments or parameters that allow disabling the meta-buffer in the existing scripts."
