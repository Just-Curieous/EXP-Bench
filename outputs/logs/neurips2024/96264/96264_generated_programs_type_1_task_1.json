    "no_answer": "After thoroughly examining the repository, I could not find any script or set of scripts that specifically answers the experiment question about the criticality of the Problem-Distiller component in BoT's pipeline. While the repository contains the BoT implementation with a Problem-Distiller component (implemented as the problem_distillation() method in the BoT class), there is no script that allows running the pipeline with and without this component to compare performance across different benchmarks. The run_benchmarks.py script allows running benchmarks with the Problem-Distiller enabled, but there's no option to disable it or compare results with and without it. Additionally, while the repository includes three of the four benchmarks mentioned in the experiment question (Game of 24, Word List Sorting, and Checkmate-in-One), it does not include the MGSM benchmark."
