The buffer-manager facilitates meta-buffer expansion and retrieval, reducing redundant template construction.\n- **Model Variants Compared**:\n  - BoT + GPT-4 (with buffer-manager) \u2013 maintains and reuses thought-templates\n  - BoT + GPT-4 (without buffer-manager) \u2013 reinitializes or ignores buffer between rounds\n- **Benchmark Coverage**:\n  - Four complex tasks used (e.g., Game of 24, Checkmate-in-One, MGSM, Python Puzzles)\n  - In each round, 50 questions per task are sampled (total 200 tasks/round)\n- **Rounds**:\n  - The evaluation is divided into 4 rounds.\n  - Each round samples new, randomly selected examples from each benchmark.\n  - Only the \u201cwith buffer-manager\u201d variant retains learned templates between rounds.\n- **Metric**:\n  - Average inference time per problem (in seconds), measured for each round\n  - Measured over all 200 tasks per round using wall-clock timing\n- **Environment**:\n  - Identical hardware setup for all runs (e.g., NVIDIA A100-40GB)\n  - Profiling code instrumented at task-level resolution\n\n#### Reproduction Steps\n\n1. **System Setup**:\n   - Launch two BoT configurations:\n     - One with persistent `buffer-manager`\n     - One with it disabled or reset between rounds\n2. **Round-based Evaluation**:\n   - For Rounds 1 to 4:\n     - Randomly sample 50 tasks per benchmark\n     - Measure inference time per task\n     - Record the average for each round\n3. **Timing Logic**:\n   - Time measured from prompt preparation to LLM response post-processing\n   - Use Python `time.time()` or equivalent for accurate measurement\n4. **Visualization**:\n   - Plot inference time per round for both variants\n   - Use line chart to show efficiency gains over time",

The without buffer-manager condition stagnates, fluctuating between 52\u201357%.\n\nThis validates that the buffer-manager enables cumulative learning by:\n- Reusing relevant templates across similar tasks\n- Expanding the `meta-buffer` to cover diverse reasoning patterns\n- Enhancing sample efficiency and scalability of BoT",
