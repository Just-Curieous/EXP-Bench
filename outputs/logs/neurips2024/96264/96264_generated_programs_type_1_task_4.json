    "no_answer": "While the repository contains code for running Buffer of Thoughts (BoT) on Checkmate-in-One, it does not contain complete scripts for comparing BoT with standard prompting, CoT, and ToT on all three tasks mentioned in the question (Checkmate-in-One, Penguins, and Date Understanding). The repository only includes benchmark data and implementation for Checkmate-in-One among these three tasks, and the run_benchmarks.py script only supports running experiments on 'gameof24', 'checkmate', and 'wordsorting'. There are no benchmark data or specific implementations for Penguins and Date Understanding tasks in this repository."
