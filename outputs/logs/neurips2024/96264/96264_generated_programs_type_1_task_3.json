    "no_answer": "After thoroughly examining the repository, I couldn't find any specific scripts that directly answer the experiment question about measuring the buffer-manager's impact on inference efficiency over multiple rounds. While the repository contains implementations of the BoT framework with the buffer-manager component (bot_pipeline.py, meta_buffer.py), scripts for running benchmarks (run_benchmarks.py), and scripts for inference (inference.py), there are no scripts that specifically measure inference time, compare BoT with and without buffer-manager over multiple rounds, or generate the data shown in Figure 10 of the paper. The repository focuses on the implementation of the BoT framework and its components, but doesn't include the specific experiment scripts that would measure inference efficiency gains over multiple rounds as described in the question."
