    "no_answer": "After thoroughly examining the repository, I couldn't find any scripts or code that specifically answer the experiment question about thought template distribution across different tasks in BoT. The repository contains implementations of the BoT framework and examples for three benchmarks (Game of 24, Checkmate-in-One, and Word Sorting), but it doesn't include code for analyzing the distribution of thought templates across the six benchmarks mentioned in the question (MGSM, Python Programming Puzzles, Sonnet Writing, Date Understanding, Table of Penguins, and Checkmate-in-One). While the meta_buffer.py file implements the meta-buffer concept and bot_pipeline.py shows how the BoT framework works, there's no specific script that measures the number of distinct thought-templates dynamically generated and stored in BoT's meta-buffer across the six benchmarks as described in the experiment question."
