    "no_answer": "While the repository contains implementation of the Buffer of Thoughts (BoT) framework and scripts to run it on Game of 24, Checkmate-in-One, and Word Sorting benchmarks, it does not contain scripts that directly answer the experiment question as specified. The repository lacks: 1) implementations of the baseline methods (Expert, PAL, ToT, Meta Prompting) for comparison, 2) support for the MGSM benchmark mentioned in the question, 3) functionality to run 10 independent repetitions as required, and 4) scripts to compute statistical validation metrics like 95% confidence intervals and p-values. The existing scripts (run_benchmarks.py and validate_results.py) only allow running and evaluating BoT on a subset of the required benchmarks, but not the full comparative experiment described in the question."
