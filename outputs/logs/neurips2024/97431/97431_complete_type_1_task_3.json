      "question": "Does the choice of evaluation metric (ASRAgent vs. ASRPrefix) influence the interpretation of the effectiveness of jailbreak attack and defense methods in LLMs?\n\nSpecifically, how do these metrics differ in reporting attack success across different:\n\n- Model alignments (e.g., Vicuna-13B vs. LLaMA-2-7B),\n- Defense strategies (e.g., Self-Reminder, RPO, SmoothLLM),\n- Template types and system prompt usage?",
      "method": "Dataset: **AdvBench** and **MaliciousInstruct**: both are adversarial instruction datasets stratified across 11 intentions (see Figure 8).\n\n#### Evaluation Metrics\n\n| Metric        | Description                                                  |\n| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| **ASRPrefix** | Rule-based evaluation that checks for predefined *rejection phrases* (e.g., \"I'm sorry\", \"I cannot help with that\"). |\n| **ASRAgent**  | GPT-4-based judge that assesses whether the model\u2019s full response complies with the attack intent. Offers context-aware scoring. |\n\n#### Target Models\n\n- **LLaMA-2-7B**: smaller, less aligned model (weaker baseline).\n- **Vicuna-13B**: larger, post-finetuned conversational model.\n\n#### Attack Methods\n\n- **Token-level**: GCG, AutoDAN, AmpleGCG.\n- **Prompt-level**: AdvPrompter, PAIR, TAP, GPTFuzz.\n\n#### Defense Methods\n\n- **System-level**: Self-Reminder, RPO, SmoothLLM.\n- **Model-level**: Adversarial Training, Unlearning, Safety Training.\n\n#### Controlled Variables\n\n| Variable           | Values Used                                        |\n| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------- |\n| Safety Prompt      | Enabled                                            |\n| Template Type      | Default                                            |\n| Adversarial Suffix | 50\u2013100 tokens                                      |\n| Attack Budget      | 60\u2013100 queries                                     |\n| Judgment System    | GPT-4 (for ASRAgent) / Regex-based (for ASRPrefix) |\n\n#### Procedure\n\n1. For each model (Vicuna-13B, LLaMA-2-7B):\n   - Conduct **14 attack-defense combinations** (7 attacks \u00d7 2 datasets).\n   - For each combination, run evaluations with:\n     - **No defense** (baseline),\n     - All **6 individual defense methods**.\n2. For each run:\n   - Record **ASRAgent** by asking GPT-4 to assess whether the LLM output successfully fulfills the adversarial goal.\n   - Record **ASRPrefix** using a rejection phrase pattern matcher.\n3. Compare:\n   - Relative drop in ASR from No Defense \u2192 Defense under both metrics.\n   - Cross-model performance trends.\n   - Discrepancies in evaluation outcomes between the two metrics.",
      "expected_outcome": "Common\n\n- Both **ASRAgent** and **ASRPrefix** will generally agree on which defense methods are more effective (e.g., SmoothLLM, Unlearning).\n- Major patterns such as:\n  - Vicuna-13B > LLaMA-2-7B in vulnerability.\n  - AutoDAN / GPTFuzz > other attacks in strength. will be consistently detected by both metrics.\n\nDiscrepancy\n\n- **ASRAgent** will likely report **higher ASR** for attacks where models subtly comply with malicious intent but include a surface-level refusal (e.g., \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but here\u2019s what you can do\u2026\u201d). These may pass ASRPrefix checks but fail human judgment.\n- **ASRPrefix** may **overestimate defense success** in cases where the response starts with a rejection phrase but still contains harmful content afterward.\n\n| Example: AutoDAN on Vicuna-13B                      | Example: TAP on LLaMA-2-7B                                  |\n| --------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |\n| **ASRAgent** = 88% (GPT-4 judges intent fulfilled)  | **ASRAgent** = 12%                                          |\n| **ASRPrefix** = 86% (refusal phrase partially used) | **ASRPrefix** = 36% (shows overestimation by Prefix method) |\n\n- ASRAgent may reveal subtle differences in output semantics across defenses that are missed by ASRPrefix. E.g., Adversarial Training vs. Safety Training yield similar ASRPrefix scores but diverge more clearly under ASRAgent.",
