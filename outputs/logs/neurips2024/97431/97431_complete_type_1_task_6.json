      "question": "How does the **choice of prompt template** affect the robustness of Large Language Models (LLMs) against jailbreak attacks? Specifically, does using a **default template** versus a **zero-shot template** significantly impact the Attack Success Rate (ASR) under token-level and prompt-level adversarial attacks?",
      "method": "#### Experiment Components\n\n- **Models Evaluated**:\n  - Llama-2-7B\n  - Llama-3-8B\n  - Vicuna-7B\n  - Qwen1.5-7B\n  - Mistral-7B\n- **Template Types**:\n  - **Default Template**: Task-specific format with instructions, roles, and safety emphasis\n  - **Zero-Shot Template**: Plain prompt without structural scaffolding or explicit safety guidance\n- **Attack Types**:\n  - **AutoDAN (Token-level)**: Adversarial suffix insertion (10\u2013100 tokens)\n  - **PAIR (Prompt-level)**: Query rewriting with attack budget < 100 prompts\n- **Input Datasets**:\n  - AdvBench\n  - MaliciousInstruct\n- **ASR Metrics**:\n  - **ASRPrefix**: Regex or keyword-based success metric\n  - **ASRAgent**: Judgment from GPT-based assistant evaluator\n- **Framework**:\n  - JailTrickBench (GitHub: [usail-hkust/JailTrickBench](https://github.com/usail-hkust/JailTrickBench))\n  - Template control modules and attack execution pipelines (AutoDAN, PAIR)\n\n#### Reproduction Steps\n\n1. **Environment & Model Setup**:\n   - Install JailTrickBench and dependencies\n   - Load all five models and validate inference behavior\n2. **Template Preparation**:\n   - For each model, generate two prompt versions:\n     - One with the default structured template\n     - One with a minimal zero-shot prompt\n3. **Attack Configuration**:\n   - Use both AutoDAN and PAIR to conduct jailbreak attempts\n   - Apply suffixes of varying lengths (10\u2013100 tokens)\n   - Run prompt attacks under the same fixed budget\n4. **Execution**:\n   - For each (model \u00d7 template \u00d7 attack) combination:\n     - Run 3\u20135 trials for statistical consistency\n     - Use both AdvBench and MaliciousInstruct prompts\n5. **Evaluation & Visualization**:\n   - Log ASRPrefix and ASRAgent results\n   - Plot ASR (%) comparisons between default vs zero-shot (bar charts as in Figure 5)\n   - Summarize effectiveness of template type per model",
      "expected_outcome": "The default template significantly enhances robustness to jailbreak attacks compared to the zero-shot template.\n\nTrend Observed in Figure 5:\n\n- **AutoDAN**: Default template consistently lowers ASR (e.g., Llama-3-8B: 68% \u2192 14%)\n- **PAIR**: Similar trend, especially for Vicuna-7B (80% \u2192 68%) and Qwen1.5-7B (58% \u2192 44%)\n- Models like Llama-3-8B benefit substantially from default prompting, while robust models (e.g., Mistral-7B) see little gain, highlighting the importance of template choice in improving safety alignment under attack.\n\n| Model      | Template  | AutoDAN ASR (%) | PAIR ASR (%) |\n| ---------- | --------- | --------------- | ------------ |\n| Llama-2-7B | Zero-shot | 46              | 12           |\n|            | Default   | 28              | 16           |\n| Llama-3-8B | Zero-shot | 68              | 26           |\n|            | Default   | 14              | 8            |\n| Vicuna-7B  | Zero-shot | 80              | 80           |\n|            | Default   | 90              | 68           |\n| Qwen1.5-7B | Zero-shot | 82              | 58           |\n|            | Default   | 84              | 44           |\n| Mistral-7B | Zero-shot | 74              | 80           |\n|            | Default   | 86              | 86           |",
