      "question": "How does fine-tuning, including domain-specific and open-chat fine-tuning, affect the safety alignment of large language models? Specifically, does fine-tuning significantly compromise robustness to jailbreak attacks, as measured by Attack Success Rate?",
      "method": "#### Experiment Components\n\n- **Models & Fine-Tuning States**:\n  - **Pre-finetuning**: Base models such as LLaMA, Mistral, Qwen1.5 before any safety tuning\n  - **Post-finetuning**: Tulu, Vicuna, WizardLM variants (e.g., Vicuna-13B, Tulu-13B, Mistral-7B-Tulu)\n- **Attack Types**:\n  - **AutoDAN** (Token-level attack): Gradient-based suffix perturbation (10\u2013100 tokens)\n  - **PAIR** (Prompt-level attack): Prefix manipulation under constrained budgets (< 100 queries)\n- **Fine-Tuning Datasets**:\n  - **Tulu v2 SFT dataset**: 326,154 instruction-tuning samples\n  - **Open-chat data**: User-shared conversations, e.g., Vicuna\u2019s fine-tuning source\n- **Controlled Variables**:\n  - Prompt template: Default template\n  - Safety system prompt: \u201cYou are a helpful and honest assistant\u2026\u201d\n  - Attack budget: Fixed across all runs\n  - Adversarial suffix lengths: 10\u2013100 tokens\n  - Evaluation metrics:\n    - **ASRPrefix** (prefix-based)\n    - **ASRAgent** (GPT judge, as per Table 7 & 8)\n- **Tools & Frameworks**:\n  - Use official [JailTrickBench](https://github.com/usail-hkust/JailTrickBench) repository\n  - Configure pre/post-finetuned checkpoints from HuggingFace or original training scripts\n  - Follow evaluation and attack pipelines for AutoDAN and PAIR\n\n#### Reproduction Steps\n\n1. **Preparation**:\n   - Clone the JailTrickBench repo and install all dependencies\n   - Prepare both pre- and post-finetuned models (e.g., LLaMA \u2192 Vicuna, Mistral \u2192 Mistral-7B-Tulu)\n   - Use Tulu v2 SFT and Vicuna datasets for fine-tuning if needed\n2. **Pre-finetuning Evaluation**:\n   - Configure model with the default prompt template and safety prompt\n   - Run **AutoDAN** with suffix lengths ranging from 10 to 100 tokens\n   - Run **PAIR** under the constrained query budget\n   - Log ASRPrefix and ASRAgent results\n3. **Fine-tuning**:\n   - Fine-tune the same base model using:\n     - Domain-specific data (e.g., Tulu)\n     - Open-chat data (e.g., user-shared dialogues)\n   - Inject a small number of adversarial examples to simulate realistic misuse risks\n4. **Post-finetuning Evaluation**:\n   - Re-run identical jailbreak attack procedures under same settings\n   - Record ASR metrics and compare with pre-finetuning results\n5. **Analysis**:\n   - Visualize change in ASR (like Figure 3 with stacked bars)\n   - Examine how much ASR increases post-finetuning for each model\n   - Analyze trends using references from Tables 3, 4, and 7",
