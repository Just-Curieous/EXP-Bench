      "question": "How does the **ability of the attacker model** affect the effectiveness of jailbreak attacks? Specifically, do stronger LLMs like GPT-4 generate more successful adversarial prompts compared to weaker or open-source models like Vicuna-13B and Llama-2-13B?",
      "method": "#### Experiment Components\n\n- **Attacker Models**:\n  - Llama-2-13B\n  - Vicuna-13B\n  - GPT-3.5 (via OpenAI API)\n  - GPT-4 (via OpenAI API)\n- **Attack Scenario**:\n  - Prompt-level adversarial refinement task using the **PAIR** pipeline\n  - Each attacker LLM generates and iteratively improves adversarial prompts targeting a fixed victim model\n  - Evaluate attack success rates of these prompts when applied to a standard target model (e.g., Llama-2-13B or GPT-4-tuned victim)\n- **Evaluation Metrics**:\n  - **ASRPrefix**: Whether the output matches harmful pattern via string/regex\n  - **ASRAgent**: Whether an evaluation agent (e.g., GPT-4 judge) deems the output harmful\n- **Datasets**:\n  - Adversarial instruction seeds from AdvBench or MaliciousInstruct\n- **Attack Pipeline**:\n  - Use the [PAIR](https://github.com/usail-hkust/JailTrickBench) refinement loop\n  - Limit iterations (e.g., 5 rounds) to generate optimized adversarial prompts\n  - Apply each generated prompt to the fixed target model and evaluate the outputs\n- **Tools**:\n  - JailTrickBench (for attack execution, logging, evaluation)\n  - OpenAI API (for GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 as attackers and optionally as judges)\n\n#### Reproduction Steps\n\n1. **Setup Environment**:\n   - Clone JailTrickBench\n   - Configure access to GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 APIs\n   - Load Llama-2-13B and Vicuna-13B locally\n2. **Configure PAIR Attack**:\n   - Fix the victim model (e.g., Vicuna-13B or Llama-2-13B)\n   - Use the same target prompts and safety system prompts\n   - For each attacker (Vicuna-13B, Llama-2-13B, GPT-3.5, GPT-4), run iterative prompt refinement\n   - Use a budgeted number of iterations (e.g., 5 refinements)\n3. **Evaluate Attack Prompts**:\n   - Deploy the final refined adversarial prompt to the victim model\n   - Compute:\n     - **ASRPrefix**: via token match\n     - **ASRAgent**: via GPT-4-as-judge or equivalent\n4. **Compare Results**:\n   - Visualize ASRPrefix and ASRAgent values per attacker (as in Figure 6a)\n   - Summarize insights on attacker strength and effectiveness",
      "expected_outcome": "- **Hypothesis**: Stronger attacker models generate more effective adversarial prompts, yielding higher ASR rates.\n- **Trend from Figure 6a**:\n  - GPT-4 achieves the highest ASRPrefix (72%) and ASRAgent (30%)\n  - GPT-3.5 follows with 24% (prefix) and 16% (agent)\n  - Vicuna-13B performs modestly: 16% (prefix), 8% (agent)\n  - Llama-2-13B is the least effective: 50% (prefix) but only 2% (agent), suggesting false positives in naive keyword-based metrics\n\n| Attacker Model | ASRPrefix (%) | ASRAgent (%) |\n| -------------- | ------------- | ------------ |\n| Vicuna-13B     | 16            | 8            |\n| Llama-2-13B    | 50            | 2            |\n| GPT-3.5        | 24            | 16           |\n| GPT-4          | 72            | 30           |\n\nStrong attacker models (GPT-4, GPT-3.5) outperform open-source counterparts due to their better understanding of prompt structure and adversarial strategy, especially under agent-based evaluation.",
