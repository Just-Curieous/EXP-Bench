      "question": "How does the **attack budget**\u2014defined as the number of optimization queries\u2014affect the **Attack Success Rate (ASR)** in both **token-level** (GCG) and **prompt-level** (PAIR) jailbreak attacks? Does increasing the number of queries lead to significantly better attack success?",
      "method": "#### Experiment Components\n\n- **Attack Types**:\n  - **Token-Level Attack**: GCG (Greedy Coordinate Gradient)\n  - **Prompt-Level Attack**: PAIR (iterative prompt editing)\n- **Budget Range**:\n  - For GCG: [150, 300, 450, 600, 750] queries\n  - For PAIR: [20, 40, 60, 80, 100] queries\n- **Target Model**:\n  - Fixed LLM (e.g., **Vicuna-13B** or **Llama-2-13B**), consistent across both attack types\n- **Constant Variables**:\n  - Prompt template (default or zero-shot)\n  - Dataset (e.g., AdvBench)\n  - Safety prompt configuration\n  - Suffix length (fixed for GCG)\n  - System prompt (unchanged)\n- **Evaluation Metrics**:\n  - **ASRPrefix**: Based on token/pattern match\n  - **ASRAgent**: Based on GPT-based evaluation of harmful output\n- **Tooling**:\n  - JailTrickBench repo for executing both GCG and PAIR pipelines\n  - GPT-4 API (if used) for ASRAgent judgments\n\n#### Reproduction Steps\n\n1. **Environment Setup**:\n   - Clone JailTrickBench\n   - Load Vicuna-13B (or chosen target model)\n   - Configure both attack pipelines (GCG for token-level, PAIR for prompt-level)\n2. **Run GCG Attack**:\n   - Fix all settings except the number of optimization iterations (attack budget)\n   - For each budget in [150, 300, 450, 600, 750], run GCG to generate adversarial suffixes\n   - Evaluate generated outputs using ASRPrefix and ASRAgent\n3. **Run PAIR Attack**:\n   - Set prompt edit iteration counts to [20, 40, 60, 80, 100]\n   - For each budget, generate adversarial prompts and evaluate ASR\n4. **Logging and Evaluation**:\n   - Track ASR values per query budget\n   - Average over 3\u20135 runs to reduce variance\n5. **Visualization**:\n   - Plot bar charts for GCG (Figure 7a) and PAIR (Figure 7b)\n   - Compare ASRPrefix and ASRAgent across budgets",
      "expected_outcome": "Increased attack budget improves token-level attacks significantly, but only marginally impacts prompt-level attacks. Token-level ASR rises sharply with increased queries, showing that more optimization enables better suffix tuning. In contrast, PAIR's performance is **relatively stable**, suggesting that a small number of prompt edits is sufficient to reach near-optimal adversarial strength.\n\nTrend from Figure 7:\n\n#### GCG (Token-Level Attack):\n\n| Budget | ASRPrefix (%) | ASRAgent (%) |\n| ------ | ------------- | ------------ |\n| 150    | 6             | 4            |\n| 300    | 10            | 8            |\n| 450    | 26            | 18           |\n| 600    | 36            | 30           |\n| 750    | 38            | 26           |\n\n#### PAIR (Prompt-Level Attack):\n\n| Budget | ASRPrefix (%) | ASRAgent (%) |\n| ------ | ------------- | ------------ |\n| 20     | 18            | 12           |\n| 40     | 22            | 16           |\n| 60     | 16            | 8            |\n| 80     | 20            | 4            |\n| 100    | 16            | 10           |",

Even with fixed budgets and settings, each run can produce slightly different adversarial suffixes or prompts due to stochastic elements (e.g., gradient variations, random initialization, and slight differences in LLM outputs). Additionally, GPT-based evaluations (ASRAgent) may fluctuate, further contributing to random uncertainty in ASR measurements.",

Such systematic factors may lead to consistent over- or under-estimations of ASR that do not vary randomly across runs.",
