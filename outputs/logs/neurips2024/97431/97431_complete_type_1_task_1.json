Load the LLaMA-2-7B base checkpoint with default system prompt and template.\n\n2. For each attack method listed above:\n\n   - Run the attack under a \"no defense\" baseline.\n   - Re-run the same attack six additional times, each time applying a different defense method.\n3. Set random seed to fix stochasticity in adversarial suffix generation or fuzzed prompt sampling.\n4. For each setting, use GPT-4 (or a predefined judge module) to classify model outputs and compute ASRAgent over 100 attack prompts.\n5. Tabulate and format the results into rows (attack methods) \u00d7 columns (defense methods), with each cell showing ASRAgent (%) success rate.",
