      "question": "Does model robustness against jailbreak attacks (measured by ASR \u2013 Attack Success Rate) depend on the model size within the Llama family? Specifically, are larger models more or less vulnerable to jailbreak attacks when subjected to token-level (AutoDAN) and prompt-level (PAIR) adversarial attacks?",
      "method": "#### Experiment Components\n\n- **Model Family**:\n  - Llama2: Llama-2-7B, Llama-2-13B, Llama-2-70B\n  - Llama3: Llama-3-8B, Llama-3-70B\n  - Optionally extend to: Qwen1.5 family (Qwen1.5-7B, Qwen1.5-14B, Qwen1.5-72B)\n- **Attack Methods**:\n  - **Token-Level Attack**: AutoDAN (gradient-based attack on input tokens with adversarial suffixes of varying lengths)\n  - **Prompt-Level Attack**: PAIR (adversarial prompt rewriting through prefix perturbation)\n- **Controlled Variables**:\n  - Default attack template\n  - Fixed safety system prompt\n  - Identical dataset input for all models\n  - Adversarial suffix lengths ranging from 10 to 100 tokens\n  - Attack budget:\n    - Token-level (AutoDAN): >100 queries\n    - Prompt-level (PAIR): <100 queries\n- **Datasets**:\n  - **AdvBench**: Harmful instruction dataset for jailbreak attack evaluation\n  - **MaliciousInstruct**: Alternative prompt set for robustness validation\n- **Evaluation Metrics**:\n  - **ASRPrefix**: Success rate measured using output overlap or harmful response indicators\n  - **ASRAgent**: Success rate evaluated via LLM-as-a-judge (GPT agent) to validate harmful behavior\n  - Both metrics correspond to Table 7 in the paper\n- **Codebase**:\n  - Use official JailTrickBench repo: https://github.com/usail-hkust/JailTrickBench\n  - Core components:\n    - `AutoDAN` attack pipeline\n    - `PAIR` attack pipeline\n    - Prompt template manager\n    - Evaluation scripts with prefix-based and agent-based metrics\n\n#### Reproduction Steps\n\n1. **Environment Setup**:\n   - Clone JailTrickBench repo and set up all dependencies (PyTorch, OpenAI API if using GPT for ASRAgent evaluation)\n   - Download/checkpoint all Llama models via Hugging Face or original model hubs (ensure compatibility with JailTrickBench)\n2. **Dataset Preparation**:\n   - Load AdvBench and MaliciousInstruct datasets\n   - Preprocess prompts using the default template and safety system prompt\n3. **Attack Configuration**:\n   - Run AutoDAN with suffix lengths from 10 to 100 tokens\n   - Run PAIR with a budget of fewer than 100 perturbation queries\n   - Fix random seeds to ensure reproducibility and control randomness\n4. **Model Execution**:\n   - Evaluate each Llama model across both attack types\n   - For each run, record ASRPrefix and ASRAgent values\n   - Run 3\u20135 trials to average results and reduce stochastic variation\n5. **Results Compilation**:\n   - Collect results for each model and attack type\n   - Visualize ASR across model sizes (replicating Figure 2 bar chart format)\n6. **Analysis**:\n   - Compare ASR trends across model sizes within the same family (Llama2 vs. Llama3)\n   - Correlate robustness with fine-tuning levels, architecture generation, and scale\n   - Test statistical significance if variance is small",
      "expected_outcome": "According to the hypothesis and the authors\u2019 findings:\n\n- **Observation**: No strong correlation between model size and jailbreak robustness.\n- **Expected ASRs**:\n  - Llama-2-7B may show higher robustness than Llama-2-70B under AutoDAN.\n  - Llama-3-70B expected to show strong resistance (ASR \u2248 0%) across both attacks.\n  - Variance in ASRs across model sizes will be minor and non-monotonic.\n- **Conclusion**: Adversarial robustness is largely independent of model size; instead, other factors like alignment, prompt template, and fine-tuning matter more.\n\nExample expected outcome plot (as per Figure 2):\n\n| Model       | AutoDAN ASR (%) | PAIR ASR (%) |\n| ----------- | --------------- | ------------ |\n| Llama-2-7B  | 32              | 8            |\n| Llama-2-13B | 14              | 10           |\n| Llama-2-70B | 10              | 14           |\n| Llama-3-8B  | 12              | 10           |\n| Llama-3-70B | 0               | 0            |",

These may pass ASRPrefix checks but fail human judgment.\n- **ASRPrefix** may **overestimate defense success** in cases where the response starts with a rejection phrase but still contains harmful content afterward.\n\n| Example: AutoDAN on Vicuna-13B                      | Example: TAP on LLaMA-2-7B                                  |\n| --------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |\n| **ASRAgent** = 88% (GPT-4 judges intent fulfilled)  | **ASRAgent** = 12%                                          |\n| **ASRPrefix** = 86% (refusal phrase partially used) | **ASRPrefix** = 36% (shows overestimation by Prefix method) |\n\n- ASRAgent may reveal subtle differences in output semantics across defenses that are missed by ASRPrefix.
