      "question": "How does the **length of adversarial suffix** used in token-level jailbreak attacks affect the **Attack Success Rate (ASR)** of LLMs? Specifically, is there a saturation point beyond which longer suffixes no longer improve attack effectiveness?",
      "method": "#### Experiment Components\n\n- **Attack Method**:\n  - **GCG** (Greedy Coordinate Gradient-based optimization) for token-level jailbreak attacks\n- **LLM Target**:\n  - One selected LLM model (e.g., **Vicuna-13B** or **Llama-2-13B**)\n- **Suffix Length Range**:\n  - Evaluate with increasing suffix lengths:\n     `[10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100]` tokens\n- **Constant Variables**:\n  - **System Prompt**: Use a fixed prompt (e.g., default safety prompt)\n  - **Prompt Template**: Fixed (default or zero-shot, not varied)\n  - **Instruction Dataset**: Use a consistent dataset (e.g., from AdvBench)\n  - **Attack Budget**: Fixed number of optimization queries across suffix lengths\n- **Evaluation Metrics**:\n  - **ASRPrefix**: Based on keyword/pattern match for harmful content\n  - **ASRAgent**: Using a GPT-based agent (e.g., GPT-4) to judge if output is harmful\n- **Tooling**:\n  - [JailTrickBench](https://github.com/usail-hkust/JailTrickBench) for adversarial generation and evaluation\n\n#### Reproduction Steps\n\n1. **Setup**:\n   - Load target model (e.g., Vicuna-13B) and set up JailTrickBench\n   - Configure GCG with constant safety prompt and dataset\n2. **Run Attack for Each Suffix Length**:\n   - Vary suffix length from 10 to 100 tokens (step of 10)\n   - For each length, run the GCG attack to generate a suffix\n   - Attach suffix to input and run it against the target model\n3. **Evaluate Output**:\n   - Compute **ASRPrefix** via pattern match\n   - Compute **ASRAgent** using GPT-4 judgment (for consistent semantic evaluation)\n4. **Log Results**:\n   - Record ASRs for each suffix length\n   - Maintain logs of token usage and query counts\n5. **Visualize**:\n   - Create bar plot of ASRPrefix and ASRAgent vs. suffix length (as in Figure 6b)",
      "expected_outcome": "Longer adversarial suffixes increase ASR until saturation (~70\u2013100 tokens), then flatten. Increasing suffix length drastically boosts ASR (especially ASRPrefix) up to 70\u201390 tokens. After that, performance gains plateau, showing diminishing returns and highlighting a tradeoff between suffix length and efficiency.\n\nExpected Trend from Figure 6b:\n\n| Suffix Length | ASRPrefix (%) | ASRAgent (%) |\n| ------------- | ------------- | ------------ |\n| 10            | 6             | 4            |\n| 20            | 2             | 2            |\n| 30            | 6             | 4            |\n| 40            | 16            | 12           |\n| 50            | 20            | 20           |\n| 60            | 30            | 18           |\n| 70            | 88            | 60           |\n| 80            | 90            | 54           |\n| 90            | 92            | 70           |\n| 100           | 92            | 64           |",
