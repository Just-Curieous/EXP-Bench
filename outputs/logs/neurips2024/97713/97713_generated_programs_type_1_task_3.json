    "no_answer": "After thoroughly exploring the repository, I couldn't find any specific scripts or examples that directly address the experiment question about evaluating chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting in WorkArena++. The repository contains the WorkArena++ benchmark tasks and infrastructure, but doesn't include specific evaluation scripts for comparing different prompting strategies like CoT vs standard prompting. While the repository provides the necessary components to build such an experiment (task definitions, environment setup, evaluation metrics), it doesn't contain ready-made scripts specifically for testing CoT prompting against standard prompting with GPT-3.5 and GPT-4o on L2 and L3 tasks."
