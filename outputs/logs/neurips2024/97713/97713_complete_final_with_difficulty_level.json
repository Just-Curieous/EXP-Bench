However, the experiment described does not require implementing the benchmark or any novel algorithm or method introduced by the paper. Instead, it involves deploying existing LLMs, standardizing conditions, executing tasks, and collecting results for evaluation. These activities are categorized as non-core because they only involve orchestrating the use of existing models and measuring performance metrics, rather than developing or implementing new methods or algorithms. There is no ambiguity in the components as described; the tasks are well-defined and do not require additional inference or guesswork."
