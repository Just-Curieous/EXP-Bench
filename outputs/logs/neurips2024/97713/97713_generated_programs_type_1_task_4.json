    "no_answer": "After thoroughly exploring the repository, I couldn't find any specific scripts that directly analyze the correlation between GPT-4o failures and specific task types in WorkArena++. While the repository contains code for defining task categories (planning_and_problem_solving, information_retrieval, data_driven_decision_making_and_reasoning, sophisticated_memory, contextual_understanding_infeasible_tasks) in curriculum.py and has infrastructure for running tasks, there are no scripts that specifically analyze model performance across these categories or perform error analysis for GPT-4o. The repository appears to be focused on providing the benchmark infrastructure rather than containing the specific analysis scripts mentioned in the experiment question."
