    "no_answer": "After thoroughly searching the repository, I could not find any scripts that specifically answer the experiment question about whether providing screenshots to the GPT-4o model improves its performance on WorkArena++ tasks. The repository contains the WorkArena benchmark code and implementation, but does not include experiment scripts for comparing GPT-4o with and without screenshots. While the README.md mentions that an agent built on GPT-4-vision was used to interact with the benchmark components, there are no scripts that directly implement the comparison experiment described in the question."
