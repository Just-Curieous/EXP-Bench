    "no_answer": "After thoroughly exploring the repository, I couldn't find a specific script or set of scripts that directly answers the experiment question about comparing the performance of different LLMs (GPT-4, GPT-4o, GPT-4o-vision, Llama3, Mixtral) on L2 vs L3 tasks. The repository provides the infrastructure to run L2 and L3 tasks separately (as shown in the README.md), but it doesn't include scripts that specifically compare the performance of these LLMs across difficulty levels. The code in the README.md shows how to run L2 tasks and mentions that you can change the filter to 'l3' to sample L3 tasks, but this doesn't include functionality to compare different LLM models or aggregate their performance metrics across difficulty levels."
