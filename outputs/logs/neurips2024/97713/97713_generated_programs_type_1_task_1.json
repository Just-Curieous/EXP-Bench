    "no_answer": "The repository does not contain a specific script or set of scripts that directly answer the question about whether LLMs with longer context windows achieve higher success rates on WorkArena++. While the repository contains code to run WorkArena++ tasks and evaluate agents, there is no ready-made experiment that compares different LLMs (GPT-4, GPT-4o, GPT-4o-vision, Llama3, Mixtral) based on their context window sizes. The README.md mentions that AgentLab (a separate repository) is the preferred way to evaluate on WorkArena, but even in that repository, there isn't a specific script that directly answers this experiment question. To conduct this experiment, one would need to create a custom script using the AgentLab framework to evaluate different LLMs with varying context window sizes on WorkArena++ tasks."
