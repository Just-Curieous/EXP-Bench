  "agent_instructions": "Your task is to create a Python script or notebook that demonstrates how to download and interact with specific samples from the HEST-1k dataset based on their metadata attributes. The HEST-1k dataset is a collection of spatial transcriptomics data hosted on HuggingFace.\n\nFollow these steps:\n\n1. Set up the environment:\n   - Install the necessary libraries (datasets from HuggingFace)\n   - Import the required modules\n   - Authenticate with HuggingFace using a token\n\n2. Download specific samples based on metadata:\n   - Load the HEST metadata CSV file from HuggingFace\n   - Filter the metadata based on specific attributes of interest (e.g., filter by organ type like 'Breast' and oncotree code like 'IDC')\n   - Extract the sample IDs from the filtered metadata\n   - Generate appropriate file patterns for the download query\n   - Download the selected samples using the datasets.load_dataset function\n\n3. Interact with the downloaded samples:\n   - Use the iter_hest function to iterate through the downloaded samples\n   - Access and display information about each sample, such as:\n     * The scanpy AnnData object (adata) containing gene expression data\n     * The Whole Slide Image (WSI)\n     * Shapes and tissue contours\n   - Demonstrate how to visualize the spots over a downscaled version of the WSI\n\nYour solution should be well-commented and include error handling where appropriate. The goal is to create a workflow that allows researchers to efficiently query and download specific samples from the HEST-1k dataset based on metadata attributes, and then interact with the downloaded data."
