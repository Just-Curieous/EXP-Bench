      "question": "- **Does the reproducibility evaluation via cross-validation across patients yield stable error bars indicating robust model performance?**",
      "method": "Perform a patient-stratified k-fold cross-validation experiment using the HEST-Benchmark. In this design, each patient is assigned to a separate fold (or in the ccRCC task, folds are merged into k/2 splits due to a large number of patients) to avoid data leakage. For each fold, extract 112\u00d7112 \u00b5m H&E patches (224\u00d7224 pixels at 20\u00d7) and compute patch embeddings using a specific foundation model. Then, train regression models (such as XGBoost with 100 estimators and Ridge regression with a fixed L2 regularization coefficient) to predict the log1p-normalized expression levels of the top 50 most variable genes.\n Detailed experiment setup: \nThe experiment uses the HEST-Benchmark dataset along with 11 foundation models for pathology. The key components of the experimental setup include: (i) using patient-stratified splits to ensure no train/test leakage, where each patient corresponds to one fold (or using k/2 folds in the ccRCC task), (ii) extracting patch embeddings and mapping these via regression models (with hyperparameters as specified in the paper and detailed in Appendix Table A11), and (iii) evaluating prediction performance using the Pearson correlation between predicted and measured gene expression. Error bars (computed as the standard deviation across all cross-validation folds) are reported to quantify variability of the performance, ensuring that each fold is treated as an independent test of the model. All experiments are executed on a single NVIDIA 3090 GPU, with complete training details provided in the paper.",

This issue is compounded by any undisclosed variations in the preprocessing steps across models.",
