    "no_answer": "After thoroughly exploring the repository, I couldn't find scripts that directly answer the experiment question about leveraging HEST-1k metadata to adjust for potential biases in data collection for improved model generalization. While the repository contains batch effect correction functionality in 'src/hest/batch_effect.py' and a tutorial '5-Batch-effect-visualization.ipynb' that demonstrates batch effect visualization and correction methods (MNN, Harmony, ComBat), these tools are designed for general batch effect correction rather than specifically incorporating metadata from the HEST-1k CSV to adjust for biases in regression models. The benchmark framework in 'src/hest/bench/benchmark.py' and 'src/hest/bench/trainer.py' provides functionality for training XGBoost and Ridge regression models on histology patch embeddings, but doesn't include options for metadata-adjusted training through reweighting samples or concatenating metadata features as described in the experiment question."
