      "question": "- **Does integrating spatial transcriptomics data with histopathological images (multimodal fine-tuning) improve the correlation with ground truth biomarker expression compared to using histology alone?**",
      "method": "Design a controlled experiment comparing a histology-only deep learning model with a multimodal model that integrates spatial transcriptomics data. Two pipelines will be developed: one that uses only H&E image patches to predict biomarker expression (e.g., using a patch encoder and aggregation network similar to hist2RNA) and another pipeline that leverages paired H&E images and spatial transcriptomics profiles. In the multimodal pipeline, a pretrained vision transformer (ViT-Base) is further fine-tuned via contrastive learning (e.g., following the CONCH framework) on paired data from, for example, five Xenium invasive breast cancer cases (four ductal and one lobular). Both pipelines will tessellate tissue sections into 256\u00d7256 patches, compress them into patch embeddings, and then aggregate these to form a slide-level representation. The ground truth biomarker expression is derived from the spatial transcriptomics profiles measured on the same tissue samples.\n Detailed experiment setup: \nDatasets: Use a cohort similar to HEST-1k and Xenium invasive breast cancer cases where both H&E images and spatial transcriptomics (ST) data are available. Models: For the histology-only model, use a pretrained patch encoder (e.g., one trained on ImageNet) followed by an attention-based aggregator to predict biomarker levels. For the multimodal model, start from the same image encoder but add a fine-tuning stage using a multimodal contrastive learning framework (such as CONCH). The contrastive learning setup aligns the morphologic features from the image patches with the corresponding gene expression profiles from ST. The experiment should include training both pipelines under similar configurations (same number of training patches, epochs, and hyperparameters where applicable) while ensuring that integration of ST data is the only difference in the multimodal approach. Evaluation: After training, assess each model by computing correlation coefficients (e.g., Pearson\u2019s R) between the model-predicted biomarker expressions and the ground truth measurements drawn from the spatial transcriptomics data. Figures and tables (e.g., Figure 38 which shows correlations such as R=0.47, p<10e-4 for biomarker FOXA1) can be referenced to compare the performance of both approaches.",
      "expected_outcome": "- Based on the reported improvement in biomarker exploration and the noted correlation (e.g., R = 0.47, p < 10e-4 in Figure 38), it is expected that multimodal integration will yield a stronger correlation with true biomarker expression levels.",

This is analogous to introducing a systematic bias like labeling based on a fixed character count in sentiment analysis.",
