    "no_answer": "After thoroughly examining the repository, I couldn't find a specific script or set of scripts that directly answer the experiment question about fine-tuning hyperparameters (learning rate, number of epochs) for the HEST-Benchmark. The repository contains a benchmark framework in `/workspace/src/hest/bench/benchmark.py` and a tutorial notebook `/workspace/tutorials/4-Running-HEST-Benchmark.ipynb`, but these are focused on running the benchmark with fixed hyperparameters rather than performing a grid search over hyperparameters. The regression models (Ridge and XGBoost) are implemented in `/workspace/src/hest/bench/trainer.py`, but there's no functionality for systematically varying the learning rate or number of epochs during fine-tuning. While the repository provides the infrastructure to run the HEST-Benchmark, it would require additional code development to implement the hyperparameter tuning experiment described in the question."
