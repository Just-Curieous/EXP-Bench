    "usage_instructions": "To compare the HEST pipeline (multimodal) with single-modality solutions using XGBoost and Ridge regression:\n\n1. First, modify the bench_config.yaml file to specify:\n   - Set 'method' to either 'ridge' or 'xgboost' to select the regression model\n   - Uncomment the datasets you want to evaluate (e.g., 'IDC', 'PRAD', etc.)\n   - Uncomment the encoders you want to use for feature extraction\n\n2. Run the benchmark script with the modified config:\n   ```\n   python /workspace/src/hest/bench/benchmark.py --config /workspace/bench_config/bench_config.yaml\n   ```\n\n3. To compare multimodal vs. single-modality approaches, run the benchmark twice:\n   - First with the standard HEST pipeline (which integrates H&E imagery with spatial transcriptomics)\n   - Then with only the H&E features (by using only image embeddings without the spatial transcriptomics data)\n\n4. The results will be saved in the directory specified by 'results_dir' in the config file, with Pearson correlation coefficients between predicted and measured biomarker expression as the evaluation metric."
