            "question": "- **Does integrating spatial transcriptomics data with histopathological images (multimodal fine-tuning) improve the correlation with ground truth biomarker expression compared to using histology alone?**",
            "method": "Design a controlled experiment comparing a histology-only deep learning model with a multimodal model that integrates spatial transcriptomics data. Two pipelines will be developed: one that uses only H&E image patches to predict biomarker expression (e.g., using a patch encoder and aggregation network similar to hist2RNA) and another pipeline that leverages paired H&E images and spatial transcriptomics profiles. In the multimodal pipeline, a pretrained vision transformer (ViT-Base) is further fine-tuned via contrastive learning (e.g., following the CONCH framework) on paired data from, for example, five Xenium invasive breast cancer cases (four ductal and one lobular). Both pipelines will tessellate tissue sections into 256\u00d7256 patches, compress them into patch embeddings, and then aggregate these to form a slide-level representation. The ground truth biomarker expression is derived from the spatial transcriptomics profiles measured on the same tissue samples.\n Detailed experiment setup: \nDatasets: Use a cohort similar to HEST-1k and Xenium invasive breast cancer cases where both H&E images and spatial transcriptomics (ST) data are available. Models: For the histology-only model, use a pretrained patch encoder (e.g., one trained on ImageNet) followed by an attention-based aggregator to predict biomarker levels. For the multimodal model, start from the same image encoder but add a fine-tuning stage using a multimodal contrastive learning framework (such as CONCH). The contrastive learning setup aligns the morphologic features from the image patches with the corresponding gene expression profiles from ST. The experiment should include training both pipelines under similar configurations (same number of training patches, epochs, and hyperparameters where applicable) while ensuring that integration of ST data is the only difference in the multimodal approach. Evaluation: After training, assess each model by computing correlation coefficients (e.g., Pearson\u2019s R) between the model-predicted biomarker expressions and the ground truth measurements drawn from the spatial transcriptomics data. Figures and tables (e.g., Figure 38 which shows correlations such as R=0.47, p<10e-4 for biomarker FOXA1) can be referenced to compare the performance of both approaches.",

            "method": "Design an experiment in which one takes one or more foundation models pretrained for histology (such as UNIv1.5 or H\u2010Optimus-0) and trains them on the HEST-Benchmark using a controlled grid search over key hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate, number of epochs) in the fine-tuning phase. Two training protocols should be compared: one using the baseline hyperparameters as reported in the paper and one in which the hyperparameters are fine-tuned. The experiment uses the same HEST-1k data splits and image patches for pretraining and applies downstream prediction of gene expression profiles via regression models (using both PCA+Ridge and XGBoost, with details as given in Tables 1, Appendix Table A13, and Appendix Table A14). Each configuration is evaluated using cross-validation across patients to compute performance metrics (Pearson correlation) and their error bars.\n Detailed experiment setup: \n\u2022 Dataset: HEST-Benchmark based on the HEST-1k dataset (with the CSV metadata provided as part of the supplementary material). Data splits should be kept consistent between experiments. \n\u2022 Models: One or more state-of-the-art foundation models (e.g., UNIv1.5 and H-Optimus-0) that have been pretrained on histology images. \n\u2022 Downstream Task: Predicting the 50 most variable gene expressions using patch embeddings via regression models (PCA+Ridge and XGBoost). The XGBoost configuration uses 100 estimators, a learning rate of 0.1, maximum depth of 3, subsampling of 0.8, and default regularization parameters (gamma 0.0, regression alpha 0.0, regression lambda 1.0). The Ridge regression uses a fixed L2 regularization parameter set to lambda = 100/MC (with M as the embedding dimension and C = 50). \n\u2022 Hyperparameter Tuning: For the fine-tuning phase, experiment with a range of learning rates and numbers of epochs. For example, use a grid search over learning rates (e.g., 1e-4, 1e-3, 1e-2) and epochs (e.g., 10, 20, 30) while keeping all other settings constant. \n\u2022 Evaluation: Use cross-validation across patient-wise splits and record the Pearson correlation along with standard deviation/error bars for each configuration. Statistical significance can be assessed with paired tests across the folds. \n\u2022 Reference to Figures: The scaling laws in Figure 2 illustrate how model size and data amount affect performance, suggesting that even logarithmic gains (as with model scaling) can be significant; a similar improvement might be expected from hyperparameter fine-tuning if the training dynamics are optimized further.",

The experiment involves training regression models to predict biomarker expression from histology patch embeddings. Two types of regression models (XGBoost and Ridge regression) are used for both pipelines. The HEST pipeline integrates multimodal data (H&E imagery with corresponding spatial transcriptomics) into unified HEST objects, while the baseline uses only the histological image features. Both pipelines are run under comparable configurations using the HEST-1k dataset, which aggregates spatial gene expression and histology data from public repositories.\n Detailed experiment setup: \n\u2022 Dataset: Use the publicly available HEST-1k dataset, which collects spatial transcriptomics data and matching H&E images standardized into HEST objects. \n\u2022 Data Preparation: Extract patch embeddings from the H&E images using foundation models (e.g., DINOv2 ViT variants). For the HEST pipeline, these embeddings are linked with the log1p-normalized expression levels of the top 50 most variable genes. \n\u2022 Models: Train two regression models \u2013 (1) XGBoost with 100 estimators, a learning rate of 0.1, maximum depth 3, 0.8 subsampling, and default gamma, alpha, and lambda settings, and (2) a Ridge regression model with an L2 regularization coefficient set to 100/(M\u00b7C) (with M being the embedding dimension and C = 50 targets). \n\u2022 Experimental Procedure: \n   - For both the HEST pipeline (integrated modality) and the baseline single-modality solution (using only H&E features), train the regression models on the same training folds. \n   - Evaluate using cross-validation (e.g., patient or fold splits) and use the Pearson correlation coefficient between predicted and measured biomarker expression (such as TPD52) as the evaluation metric. \n\u2022 Benchmarking: Refer to HEST-Benchmark experiments where similar setups have been used and compare performance across tasks. Additional details on model configurations and comparisons (e.g., Table A12 and Appendix C.3) provide complementary evidence. Figures such as Figure 38 (which shows a significant correlation between morphological metrics and gene expression, R = 0.47, p < 10e-4) further demonstrate the link between tissue morphology and gene expression.",

For each fold, extract 112\u00d7112 \u00b5m H&E patches (224\u00d7224 pixels at 20\u00d7) and compute patch embeddings using a specific foundation model.

The key components of the experimental setup include: (i) using patient-stratified splits to ensure no train/test leakage, where each patient corresponds to one fold (or using k/2 folds in the ccRCC task), (ii) extracting patch embeddings and mapping these via regression models (with hyperparameters as specified in the paper and detailed in Appendix Table A11), and (iii) evaluating prediction performance using the Pearson correlation between predicted and measured gene expression. Error bars (computed as the standard deviation across all cross-validation folds) are reported to quantify variability of the performance, ensuring that each fold is treated as an independent test of the model.

In the metadata-adjusted pipeline, the CSV metadata from HEST-1k is leveraged to account for potential biases (such as differences in acquisition times, institutions, or collection protocols) via either reweighting samples or by including metadata as additional input features during model training.\n Detailed experiment setup: \nDataset: Use the HEST-1k dataset that includes histology images, corresponding gene expression profiles (the 50 most variable genes per task), and detailed metadata provided in CSV format. Models: Train an XGBoost regression model (configured with 100 estimators, a 0.1 learning rate, max depth of 3, 0.8 subsampling, gamma = 0.0, regression alpha = 0.0, and regression lambda = 1.0) and a Ridge regression model (using an L2 regularization coefficient set to 100/MC, where M is the embedding dimension and C = 50 targets). Experimental Setup: \n1. Baseline: Train the regression models solely on the histology patch embeddings (without any metadata adjustments) using the predefined patient-stratified splits (as provided in the CSV). Cross-validation will be performed to compute performance metrics (e.g., R\u00b2 values, standard deviations as error bars as described in HEST-Benchmark). \n2. Metadata-Adjusted: Incorporate metadata into the training process. This can be done by either (a) reweighting training samples based on potential bias indicators from the metadata (such as differences in collection timeframes or centers), or (b) concatenating metadata features with patch embeddings as input for the regression models. Use the same training and evaluation splits as in the baseline to ensure comparability. Evaluation: Compare prediction accuracies (R\u00b2 scores and standard deviations computed from cross-validation across all patients) between the two pipelines. The effect of bias adjustment will be particularly assessed on unseen patient data to evaluate model generalization.",
