      "question": "- **Does the proposed HEST pipeline outperform existing single-modality solutions in predicting biomarker expression under comparable configurations?**",
      "method": "Design an experiment that compares the HEST pipeline to a baseline single\u2010modality solution. The experiment involves training regression models to predict biomarker expression from histology patch embeddings. Two types of regression models (XGBoost and Ridge regression) are used for both pipelines. The HEST pipeline integrates multimodal data (H&E imagery with corresponding spatial transcriptomics) into unified HEST objects, while the baseline uses only the histological image features. Both pipelines are run under comparable configurations using the HEST-1k dataset, which aggregates spatial gene expression and histology data from public repositories.\n Detailed experiment setup: \n\u2022 Dataset: Use the publicly available HEST-1k dataset, which collects spatial transcriptomics data and matching H&E images standardized into HEST objects. \n\u2022 Data Preparation: Extract patch embeddings from the H&E images using foundation models (e.g., DINOv2 ViT variants). For the HEST pipeline, these embeddings are linked with the log1p-normalized expression levels of the top 50 most variable genes. \n\u2022 Models: Train two regression models \u2013 (1) XGBoost with 100 estimators, a learning rate of 0.1, maximum depth 3, 0.8 subsampling, and default gamma, alpha, and lambda settings, and (2) a Ridge regression model with an L2 regularization coefficient set to 100/(M\u00b7C) (with M being the embedding dimension and C = 50 targets). \n\u2022 Experimental Procedure: \n   - For both the HEST pipeline (integrated modality) and the baseline single-modality solution (using only H&E features), train the regression models on the same training folds. \n   - Evaluate using cross-validation (e.g., patient or fold splits) and use the Pearson correlation coefficient between predicted and measured biomarker expression (such as TPD52) as the evaluation metric. \n\u2022 Benchmarking: Refer to HEST-Benchmark experiments where similar setups have been used and compare performance across tasks. Additional details on model configurations and comparisons (e.g., Table A12 and Appendix C.3) provide complementary evidence. Figures such as Figure 38 (which shows a significant correlation between morphological metrics and gene expression, R = 0.47, p < 10e-4) further demonstrate the link between tissue morphology and gene expression.",
