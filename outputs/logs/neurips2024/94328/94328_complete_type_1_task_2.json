These choices, coupled with the fixed FP16 baseline for non-quantized components and a single dataset (WikiText-2), may introduce consistent biases in the reported performance. For instance, a clipping ratio that is too low can lead to over-clipping and a systematic increase in quantization error, while a high ratio may not fully suppress outliers, both resulting in a stable yet biased shift in perplexity.",
