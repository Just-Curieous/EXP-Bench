    "no_answer": "After thoroughly examining the repository, I found that the codebase only supports LLAMA and OPT models, with no implementation for Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct or other non-LLAMA models. The main.py script in the fake_quant directory is the primary script for running experiments, but it explicitly checks for 'llama' in the model name for certain operations (e.g., GPTQ weight quantization). The model_utils.py file only has functions to handle LLAMA and OPT models, with no support for Phi models. There are no references to 'phi', 'microsoft/phi', or any code that would enable generalization to non-LLAMA models in the codebase. To answer the experiment question, the codebase would need to be extended to support Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct models."
