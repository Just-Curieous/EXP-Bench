  "agent_instructions": "Your task is to implement a script that demonstrates how to identify causal structure in a linear non-Gaussian system using the DirectLiNGAM algorithm.\n\nThe DirectLiNGAM algorithm is designed to discover causal relationships between variables in a system where:\n1. The relationships between variables are linear\n2. The error terms follow non-Gaussian distributions\n3. The causal structure forms a directed acyclic graph (DAG)\n\nFollow these steps to complete the task:\n\n1. Generate synthetic data with a clear causal structure where X0 causes X1, which in turn causes X2. Use non-Gaussian distributions (such as uniform) for the error terms to ensure the algorithm works correctly.\n\n2. Apply the DirectLiNGAM algorithm to discover the causal structure:\n   - Import the DirectLiNGAM class from the causallearn library\n   - Create an instance of the DirectLiNGAM class\n   - Fit the model to your generated data\n\n3. Extract and interpret the results:\n   - Get the causal order from the model's causal_order_ attribute\n   - Get the adjacency matrix from the model's adjacency_matrix_ attribute\n   - Verify that the discovered causal order matches the expected order [0,1,2]\n   - Examine the adjacency matrix to confirm it correctly represents the causal structure with appropriate edge weights\n\nThe expected outcome is that the DirectLiNGAM algorithm correctly identifies the causal order [0,1,2] and produces an adjacency matrix showing the connections 0->1->2 with appropriate edge weights."
