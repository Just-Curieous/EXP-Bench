  "agent_instructions": "Your task is to demonstrate how the PC algorithm can be used to discover causal relationships in observational data. Follow these steps:\n\n1. Set up your environment by importing the necessary libraries:\n   - Import the PC algorithm from causallearn.search.ConstraintBased.PC\n   - Import the Fisher-Z conditional independence test from causallearn.utils.cit\n   - Import any visualization libraries you might need\n\n2. Define a simple causal structure that will serve as the ground truth. For example, you could use a chain structure like 0→1→2→3→4, where each node causally influences the next one in sequence.\n\n3. Generate synthetic data that follows this causal structure:\n   - Create a function to generate linear Gaussian data based on the defined causal structure\n   - Use an appropriate sample size (e.g., 1000-10000 samples) to ensure reliable results\n   - The data should represent observations from a system where the true causal relationships are known\n\n4. Apply the PC algorithm to the generated data:\n   - Use the Fisher-Z conditional independence test which is appropriate for continuous data\n   - Set an appropriate significance level (e.g., 0.05) for the conditional independence tests\n   - Run the algorithm to discover the causal structure from the data\n\n5. Analyze the results:\n   - Extract the directed edges from the resulting causal graph\n   - Compare the discovered causal structure with the true structure\n   - Calculate any relevant metrics to evaluate the algorithm's performance\n\n6. Visualize and interpret the results:\n   - Create a visual representation of both the true and discovered causal graphs\n   - Discuss any differences between the true and discovered structures\n   - Explain how the PC algorithm was able to identify causal relationships from purely observational data\n\nThe goal is to demonstrate how the PC algorithm, combined with the Fisher-Z test, can recover causal relationships from observational data when the true causal structure is known."
