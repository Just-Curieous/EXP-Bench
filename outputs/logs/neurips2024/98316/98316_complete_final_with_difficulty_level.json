            "method": "The experiment would involve using a well\u2010curated observational genomic dataset that contains gene expression measurements and known gene\u2013disease associations as ground truth. The plan is to employ the causal-learn library by running several causal discovery algorithms (for example, the constraint-based Peter-Clark (PC) algorithm and any other methods available in the library) to reconstruct the underlying causal graph from the observational data.\n Detailed experiment setup: \n1. Dataset: Select an observational genomic dataset (such as one from a public genomic database) where there are established gene\u2013disease associations. The dataset should include sufficient gene expression measurements along with disease status information to provide a basis for evaluating the recovered causal structure.\n2. Preprocessing: Normalize and preprocess the data appropriately. Identify a subset of genes for which the literature provides known causal relationships with the disease.\n3. Algorithms: Utilize several causal discovery algorithms implemented in causal-learn (e.g., the PC algorithm, FCI, score-based approaches) to learn the causal structure. Configure the methods using recommended parameters (e.g., significance thresholds for conditional independence tests) as detailed in the library documentation (version 0.1.3.8).\n4. Pipeline: Assemble the analysis pipeline using the provided utilities for graph operations. Import the dataset using the functions included in the library and run the selected methods to obtain candidate causal graphs.\n5. Evaluation: Compare the recovered graph structure against the known gene\u2013disease relationships drawn from domain knowledge or a benchmark table (e.g., as summarized in Table 1 of the paper, which lists the implemented algorithms and their configurations). Calculate performance metrics (precision, recall, etc.) to quantify how well the known causal links are recovered.",

Datasets: Use a collection of benchmark datasets provided by causal\u2010learn, including synthetic datasets with known ground-truth causal graphs and real-world datasets with partially known causal relations. These datasets should cover various complexity levels, sample sizes, and noise conditions. \n2. Models and Algorithms: Use a representative causal discovery algorithm (for instance, the PC algorithm) implemented in causal-learn. Run the algorithm under different configurations by replacing the CI test component. Specifically, test the built-in CI tests such as the Fisher-z test, Missing-value Fisher-z test, Chi-Square test, and the Kernel-based conditional independence (KCI) test against traditional or custom implementations of these tests outside of the causal\u2010learn framework. \n3.

The only variable controlled is the choice of the CI test. \n4. Evaluation Metrics: Evaluate the recovered causal graphs using metrics such as Structural Hamming Distance (SHD), precision, recall, and F1 score. Compare these metrics across different CI test configurations. \n5. Experimental Procedure: \n   a. For each dataset, run the PC algorithm multiple times (to average over randomness if applicable) using built-in CI tests from causal\u2010learn. \n   b. Run the same PC algorithm using traditional or custom CI tests with the same configurations. \n   c. Collect and analyze the metrics mentioned above. \n6.

The core of the paper is the development of causal-learn itself, not the comparative experiment setup. The method and requirements provided do not specify any novel algorithm or method that needs to be implemented for the experiment, thus there are no core components identified.

(2018).\n Detailed experiment setup: \nThe experiment design consists of the following steps: (1) Select a set of benchmark datasets that have been previously used in causal discovery (the causal-learn package provides several well\u2010tested benchmark datasets with partially known ground\u2010truth causal relations). The datasets should include synthetic data generated under various assumptions (e.g. Gaussian, non-Gaussian, and heteroscedastic noise settings) to cover different data distributions and functional relations. (2) Configure the GES algorithm twice: once with a standard score function (e.g. BIC or BDeu) and once with the generalized score function. (3) Run repeated experiments on each dataset, ensuring that all other configurations such as search space, intervention on initial graphs, and hyperparameters remain identical between the two configurations. (4) Evaluate the recovery of the underlying causal structure using relevant metrics such as the Structural Hamming Distance (SHD), precision, and recall of the recovered edges. (5) Compare the two configurations across different datasets and data generating processes. Relevant details from the paper indicate that while standard score functions output Markov equivalence classes, the generalized score function may better distinguish between different DAGs where functional causal models can be exploited.",

Step 2, generating synthetic data, is considered non-core as it is data preparation rather than the implementation of the causal discovery method itself. Steps 3 to 8 involve initializing the ANM object, calling methods, fitting models, computing residuals, and testing independence\u2014these are primarily orchestration steps using existing functionality and hence non-core. The final step, interpreting results, is also non-core as it involves understanding the output rather than implementing the algorithm. The reconstruction script '/workspace/causallearn/search/FCMBased/ANM/ANM.py' likely contains core logic for implementing the ANM method itself, making it the core component in this task. There is no ambiguity in the task description as the requirements are clearly detailed, specifying each step with associated script lines."
