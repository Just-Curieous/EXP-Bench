      "method": "The experiment would involve using a well\u2010curated observational genomic dataset that contains gene expression measurements and known gene\u2013disease associations as ground truth. The plan is to employ the causal-learn library by running several causal discovery algorithms (for example, the constraint-based Peter-Clark (PC) algorithm and any other methods available in the library) to reconstruct the underlying causal graph from the observational data.\n Detailed experiment setup: \n1. Dataset: Select an observational genomic dataset (such as one from a public genomic database) where there are established gene\u2013disease associations. The dataset should include sufficient gene expression measurements along with disease status information to provide a basis for evaluating the recovered causal structure.\n2. Preprocessing: Normalize and preprocess the data appropriately. Identify a subset of genes for which the literature provides known causal relationships with the disease.\n3. Algorithms: Utilize several causal discovery algorithms implemented in causal-learn (e.g., the PC algorithm, FCI, score-based approaches) to learn the causal structure. Configure the methods using recommended parameters (e.g., significance thresholds for conditional independence tests) as detailed in the library documentation (version 0.1.3.8).\n4. Pipeline: Assemble the analysis pipeline using the provided utilities for graph operations. Import the dataset using the functions included in the library and run the selected methods to obtain candidate causal graphs.\n5. Evaluation: Compare the recovered graph structure against the known gene\u2013disease relationships drawn from domain knowledge or a benchmark table (e.g., as summarized in Table 1 of the paper, which lists the implemented algorithms and their configurations). Calculate performance metrics (precision, recall, etc.) to quantify how well the known causal links are recovered.",
