      "hypothesis": "Will using the built-in conditional independence tests in causal-learn improve the accuracy of recovered causal graphs compared to traditional or custom tests?",
      "method": "Design an experiment that compares the performance of causal discovery algorithms (such as the PC algorithm) when using causal\u2010learn's built-in conditional independence tests versus traditional or custom tests. The experiment involves running the same causal discovery algorithm under different configurations, where the only changing factor is the choice of the conditional independence test.\n Detailed experiment setup: \n1. Datasets: Use a collection of benchmark datasets provided by causal\u2010learn, including synthetic datasets with known ground-truth causal graphs and real-world datasets with partially known causal relations. These datasets should cover various complexity levels, sample sizes, and noise conditions. \n2. Models and Algorithms: Use a representative causal discovery algorithm (for instance, the PC algorithm) implemented in causal-learn. Run the algorithm under different configurations by replacing the CI test component. Specifically, test the built-in CI tests such as the Fisher-z test, Missing-value Fisher-z test, Chi-Square test, and the Kernel-based conditional independence (KCI) test against traditional or custom implementations of these tests outside of the causal\u2010learn framework. \n3. Configurations: Ensure that all runs use the same settings for other parameters (e.g., significance levels, sample sizes, initialization). The only variable controlled is the choice of the CI test. \n4. Evaluation Metrics: Evaluate the recovered causal graphs using metrics such as Structural Hamming Distance (SHD), precision, recall, and F1 score. Compare these metrics across different CI test configurations. \n5. Experimental Procedure: \n   a. For each dataset, run the PC algorithm multiple times (to average over randomness if applicable) using built-in CI tests from causal\u2010learn. \n   b. Run the same PC algorithm using traditional or custom CI tests with the same configurations. \n   c. Collect and analyze the metrics mentioned above. \n6. Tools: Leverage the utilities and benchmark dataset suite provided by causal\u2010learn for reproducibility and to ensure a fair comparison (as noted in the provided documentation and Table 1 in the paper).",
      "expected_outcome": "The paper implies that the integration of various (conditional) independence tests leads to more robust and accurate causal discovery; experiments on synthetic data with known ground truth should show enhanced performance with these built-in tests.",

      "usage_instructions": "Execute the script with 'python /workspace/tests/test_custom_ci.py'. This script demonstrates how to create a custom conditional independence test (CustomFisherZ) and compare it with the built-in Fisher-Z test in causal-learn. The script includes two main functions: run_test() which compares p-values from both tests, and run_pc_algorithm_test() which runs the PC algorithm with both tests on synthetic data with a known causal structure. The script evaluates and compares the performance of both tests by measuring the match percentage between the recovered causal graphs, which directly addresses the hypothesis about whether built-in tests improve accuracy. The script already includes synthetic data generation with known ground truth, so no additional data preparation is needed.",
