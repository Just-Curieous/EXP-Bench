    "no_answer": "After a thorough examination of the repository, I could not find any specific scripts or examples that directly compare the computational time between modular graph operations and manually assembled approaches as described in the experiment question. The repository contains various test scripts (like TestPC.py, TestEvaluation.py) and utility modules (like GraphUtils.py) that demonstrate the use of modular graph operations, but none that explicitly benchmark the performance difference between modular and non-modular implementations. While the repository provides comprehensive tools for graph operations, evaluation metrics (precision, recall, SHD), and causal discovery methods, there is no ready-made experiment that answers the specific hypothesis about computational time reduction."
