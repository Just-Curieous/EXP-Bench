  "agent_instructions": "Your task is to implement an experiment that demonstrates how the CAMUV (Causal Additive Models with Unobserved Variables) algorithm can discover causal relationships in data with unobserved common causes.\n\nFollow these steps:\n\n1. Import the necessary libraries including numpy, random, and the CAMUV module from causallearn.search.FCMBased.lingam\n\n2. Create helper functions to generate synthetic data with a known causal structure:\n   - A function to generate random noise\n   - A non-linear causal function to transform cause variables\n   - A function to generate random constants within specified ranges\n   - A main data generation function that creates a dataset with:\n     * Direct causal relationships between observed variables\n     * Effects from unobserved common causes\n     * Effects mediated through unobserved intermediate variables\n\n3. Generate a synthetic dataset with the following structure:\n   - Direct causal relationships: 0->1, 0->3, 2->4\n   - Variable pairs with unobserved intermediate variables: {2,5}\n   - Variable pairs with unobserved common causes: {3,4}\n   - Use a sufficient sample size (around 2000 samples) for reliable results\n\n4. Apply the CAMUV algorithm to the generated data:\n   - Use the CAMUV.execute method with appropriate parameters\n   - Set a significance level (e.g., 0.01) for independence testing\n   - Specify the maximum number of explanatory variables (e.g., 3)\n\n5. Extract and display the results:\n   - Show the direct causal relationships identified by the algorithm\n   - Show the variable pairs that have unobserved common causes or unobserved intermediate variables\n\n6. Verify that the algorithm correctly identifies:\n   - The direct causal relationships (0->1, 0->3, 2->4)\n   - The variable pairs with unobserved common causes ({3,4})\n   - The variable pairs with unobserved intermediate variables ({2,5})\n\nThe goal is to demonstrate how the CAMUV algorithm can successfully discover both direct causal relationships and detect the presence of unobserved variables in the causal structure."
