    "usage_instructions": "To evaluate if causal-learn accurately recovers known gene-disease causal relationships in genomic datasets, you can use the Sachs dataset which is a well-curated genomic dataset with known ground truth. First, load the Sachs dataset using the Dataset utility, then apply the PC algorithm to discover the causal structure, and finally evaluate the results against the known ground truth. Here's how to do it:\n\n1. Load the Sachs dataset using the Dataset utility:\n```python\nfrom causallearn.utils.Dataset import load_dataset\n\n# Load the Sachs dataset (protein signaling network data)\ndata, labels = load_dataset('sachs')\n```\n\n2. Apply the PC algorithm with appropriate parameters:\n```python\nfrom causallearn.search.ConstraintBased.PC import pc\nfrom causallearn.utils.cit import fisherz\n\n# Run PC algorithm with Fisher's Z test (appropriate for continuous data)\ncg = pc(data, 0.05, fisherz)\n```\n\n3. Evaluate the results against the known ground truth:\n```python\nfrom causallearn.utils.TXT2GeneralGraph import txt2generalgraph\nfrom causallearn.graph.SHD import SHD\n\n# You can load the ground truth from the benchmark datasets repository\n# or use the known structure of the Sachs dataset\n# Compare the discovered graph with the ground truth\ndiscovered_edges = set(cg.find_fully_directed())\nprint(\"Discovered directed edges:\", discovered_edges)\n\n# Visualize the discovered graph\ncg.draw_pydot_graph(labels=labels)\n```\n\nThe Sachs dataset represents protein signaling networks, which is a genomic dataset with known causal relationships. The PC algorithm should be able to recover a significant portion of the known causal structure, allowing you to evaluate its performance in genomic data analysis."
