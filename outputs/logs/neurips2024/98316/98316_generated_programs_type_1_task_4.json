    "no_answer": "After thoroughly exploring the repository, I couldn't find a specific script or set of scripts that directly answers the experiment question about comparing causal discovery performance between causal-learn version 0.1.3.8 and newer versions. While the repository contains test scripts for individual algorithms (TestPC.py, TestGES.py, etc.) and evaluation utilities (TestEvaluation.py), there isn't a dedicated benchmarking framework for comparing different versions of the library. The paper mentions that causal-learn is under active development to incorporate the most recent advancements in causal discovery, but doesn't reference a specific benchmarking script. The repository does contain utilities for evaluation metrics like Structural Hamming Distance (SHD), precision, and recall that could be used to build such a comparison, but a ready-made solution for version comparison doesn't exist in the current codebase."
