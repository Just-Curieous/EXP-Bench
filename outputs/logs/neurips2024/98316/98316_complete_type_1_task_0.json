      "hypothesis": "In genomic datasets, does causal-learn accurately recover known gene-disease causal relationships?",
      "method": "The experiment would involve using a well\u2010curated observational genomic dataset that contains gene expression measurements and known gene\u2013disease associations as ground truth. The plan is to employ the causal-learn library by running several causal discovery algorithms (for example, the constraint-based Peter-Clark (PC) algorithm and any other methods available in the library) to reconstruct the underlying causal graph from the observational data.\n Detailed experiment setup: \n1. Dataset: Select an observational genomic dataset (such as one from a public genomic database) where there are established gene\u2013disease associations. The dataset should include sufficient gene expression measurements along with disease status information to provide a basis for evaluating the recovered causal structure.\n2. Preprocessing: Normalize and preprocess the data appropriately. Identify a subset of genes for which the literature provides known causal relationships with the disease.\n3. Algorithms: Utilize several causal discovery algorithms implemented in causal-learn (e.g., the PC algorithm, FCI, score-based approaches) to learn the causal structure. Configure the methods using recommended parameters (e.g., significance thresholds for conditional independence tests) as detailed in the library documentation (version 0.1.3.8).\n4. Pipeline: Assemble the analysis pipeline using the provided utilities for graph operations. Import the dataset using the functions included in the library and run the selected methods to obtain candidate causal graphs.\n5. Evaluation: Compare the recovered graph structure against the known gene\u2013disease relationships drawn from domain knowledge or a benchmark table (e.g., as summarized in Table 1 of the paper, which lists the implemented algorithms and their configurations). Calculate performance metrics (precision, recall, etc.) to quantify how well the known causal links are recovered.",
      "expected_outcome": "Based on the motivation discussed in the paper, causal discovery via causal-learn should uncover gene-disease relationships that largely agree with established domain knowledge, validating its practical utility in genomics.",

      "usage_instructions": "To evaluate if causal-learn accurately recovers known gene-disease causal relationships in genomic datasets, you can use the Sachs dataset which is a well-curated genomic dataset with known ground truth. First, load the Sachs dataset using the Dataset utility, then apply the PC algorithm to discover the causal structure, and finally evaluate the results against the known ground truth. Here's how to do it:\n\n1. Load the Sachs dataset using the Dataset utility:\n```python\nfrom causallearn.utils.Dataset import load_dataset\n\n# Load the Sachs dataset (protein signaling network data)\ndata, labels = load_dataset('sachs')\n```\n\n2. Apply the PC algorithm with appropriate parameters:\n```python\nfrom causallearn.search.ConstraintBased.PC import pc\nfrom causallearn.utils.cit import fisherz\n\n# Run PC algorithm with Fisher's Z test (appropriate for continuous data)\ncg = pc(data, 0.05, fisherz)\n```\n\n3. Evaluate the results against the known ground truth:\n```python\nfrom causallearn.utils.TXT2GeneralGraph import txt2generalgraph\nfrom causallearn.graph.SHD import SHD\n\n# You can load the ground truth from the benchmark datasets repository\n# or use the known structure of the Sachs dataset\n# Compare the discovered graph with the ground truth\ndiscovered_edges = set(cg.find_fully_directed())\nprint(\"Discovered directed edges:\", discovered_edges)\n\n# Visualize the discovered graph\ncg.draw_pydot_graph(labels=labels)\n```\n\nThe Sachs dataset represents protein signaling networks, which is a genomic dataset with known causal relationships. The PC algorithm should be able to recover a significant portion of the known causal structure, allowing you to evaluate its performance in genomic data analysis.",
