            "hypothesis": "In genomic datasets, does causal-learn accurately recover known gene-disease causal relationships?",
            "method": "The experiment would involve using a well\u2010curated observational genomic dataset that contains gene expression measurements and known gene\u2013disease associations as ground truth. The plan is to employ the causal-learn library by running several causal discovery algorithms (for example, the constraint-based Peter-Clark (PC) algorithm and any other methods available in the library) to reconstruct the underlying causal graph from the observational data.\n Detailed experiment setup: \n1. Dataset: Select an observational genomic dataset (such as one from a public genomic database) where there are established gene\u2013disease associations. The dataset should include sufficient gene expression measurements along with disease status information to provide a basis for evaluating the recovered causal structure.\n2. Preprocessing: Normalize and preprocess the data appropriately. Identify a subset of genes for which the literature provides known causal relationships with the disease.\n3. Algorithms: Utilize several causal discovery algorithms implemented in causal-learn (e.g., the PC algorithm, FCI, score-based approaches) to learn the causal structure. Configure the methods using recommended parameters (e.g., significance thresholds for conditional independence tests) as detailed in the library documentation (version 0.1.3.8).\n4. Pipeline: Assemble the analysis pipeline using the provided utilities for graph operations. Import the dataset using the functions included in the library and run the selected methods to obtain candidate causal graphs.\n5. Evaluation: Compare the recovered graph structure against the known gene\u2013disease relationships drawn from domain knowledge or a benchmark table (e.g., as summarized in Table 1 of the paper, which lists the implemented algorithms and their configurations). Calculate performance metrics (precision, recall, etc.) to quantify how well the known causal links are recovered.",
            "expected_outcome": "Based on the motivation discussed in the paper, causal discovery via causal-learn should uncover gene-disease relationships that largely agree with established domain knowledge, validating its practical utility in genomics."

            "hypothesis": "Will using the built-in conditional independence tests in causal-learn improve the accuracy of recovered causal graphs compared to traditional or custom tests?",
            "method": "Design an experiment that compares the performance of causal discovery algorithms (such as the PC algorithm) when using causal\u2010learn's built-in conditional independence tests versus traditional or custom tests. The experiment involves running the same causal discovery algorithm under different configurations, where the only changing factor is the choice of the conditional independence test.\n Detailed experiment setup: \n1. Datasets: Use a collection of benchmark datasets provided by causal\u2010learn, including synthetic datasets with known ground-truth causal graphs and real-world datasets with partially known causal relations. These datasets should cover various complexity levels, sample sizes, and noise conditions. \n2. Models and Algorithms: Use a representative causal discovery algorithm (for instance, the PC algorithm) implemented in causal-learn. Run the algorithm under different configurations by replacing the CI test component. Specifically, test the built-in CI tests such as the Fisher-z test, Missing-value Fisher-z test, Chi-Square test, and the Kernel-based conditional independence (KCI) test against traditional or custom implementations of these tests outside of the causal\u2010learn framework. \n3. Configurations: Ensure that all runs use the same settings for other parameters (e.g., significance levels, sample sizes, initialization). The only variable controlled is the choice of the CI test. \n4. Evaluation Metrics: Evaluate the recovered causal graphs using metrics such as Structural Hamming Distance (SHD), precision, recall, and F1 score. Compare these metrics across different CI test configurations. \n5. Experimental Procedure: \n   a. For each dataset, run the PC algorithm multiple times (to average over randomness if applicable) using built-in CI tests from causal\u2010learn. \n   b. Run the same PC algorithm using traditional or custom CI tests with the same configurations. \n   c. Collect and analyze the metrics mentioned above. \n6. Tools: Leverage the utilities and benchmark dataset suite provided by causal\u2010learn for reproducibility and to ensure a fair comparison (as noted in the provided documentation and Table 1 in the paper).",
            "expected_outcome": "The paper implies that the integration of various (conditional) independence tests leads to more robust and accurate causal discovery; experiments on synthetic data with known ground truth should show enhanced performance with these built-in tests."

            "hypothesis": "Does the implementation of modular graph operations and utilities in causal-learn reduce the overall computational time in assembling and analyzing causal pipelines?",
            "method": "A comparative performance evaluation experiment is proposed. The idea is to compare causal pipelines constructed with the modular graph operations and utilities provided by causal\u2010learn against pipelines built using a less modular, more manually assembled approach. For each approach, a series of causal discovery tasks will be executed using standard benchmark datasets (which can be imported via the provided functions) to create graphs (e.g., DAGs, CPDAGs, PDAGs, and PAGs) and calculate evaluation metrics such as precision, recall, and the Structural Hamming Distance.\n Detailed experiment setup: \n1. Datasets: Use a collection of benchmark datasets provided by causal-learn\u2019s dataset import functions, which include both simulated and partially real-world datasets with known causal relations. \n2. Models and Pipeline Construction: \n   - Pipeline A: Construct the causal pipeline using causal-learn\u2019s modular utilities to perform graph transformations, causal discovery method application (from the table of methods), and evaluation metric computations. \n   - Pipeline B (Baseline): Construct an equivalent pipeline manually in Python without using the built-in utilities and modular graph operations, so that individual steps (graph conversion, evaluation metric computations, etc.) are implemented from scratch or using generic libraries. \n3. Configurations: Run experiments on a standardized computing environment. For each pipeline, measure the total computational time required to assemble the pipeline (i.e., set up graphs, execute the analysis methods, and perform metric evaluations) as well as the execution time of the complete causal discovery task. Repeat the experiments across various graph sizes and datasets to test scalability and consistency. \n4. Evaluation: Compare the overall computational time and ease of assembly, while also verifying that both pipelines yield comparable analytical results (using the evaluation metrics provided, such as SHD, precision, and recall as shown in the relevant tables/figures).",

            "hypothesis": "Will changing the score function configuration (for example, using generalized score functions vs. standard score functions) lead to improved recovery of the causal structure?",
            "method": "Use a score\u2010based causal discovery method (for example, Greedy Equivalence Search, GES) and vary its score function between a standard one (such as BIC or BDeu) and the generalized score function described by Huang et al. (2018).\n Detailed experiment setup: \nThe experiment design consists of the following steps: (1) Select a set of benchmark datasets that have been previously used in causal discovery (the causal-learn package provides several well\u2010tested benchmark datasets with partially known ground\u2010truth causal relations). The datasets should include synthetic data generated under various assumptions (e.g. Gaussian, non-Gaussian, and heteroscedastic noise settings) to cover different data distributions and functional relations. (2) Configure the GES algorithm twice: once with a standard score function (e.g. BIC or BDeu) and once with the generalized score function. (3) Run repeated experiments on each dataset, ensuring that all other configurations such as search space, intervention on initial graphs, and hyperparameters remain identical between the two configurations. (4) Evaluate the recovery of the underlying causal structure using relevant metrics such as the Structural Hamming Distance (SHD), precision, and recall of the recovered edges. (5) Compare the two configurations across different datasets and data generating processes. Relevant details from the paper indicate that while standard score functions output Markov equivalence classes, the generalized score function may better distinguish between different DAGs where functional causal models can be exploited.",
            "expected_outcome": "Given that the library provides multiple score functions refined through prior research, experiments should reveal that certain configurations (e.g., generalized score functions) yield higher accuracy in causal graph recovery under specific conditions."

            "method": "Design a comparative experiment in which the causal discovery performance of causal\u2010learn version 0.1.3.8 is compared with that of a newer version incorporating the most recent algorithms. Use both synthetic and real-world benchmark datasets with known or partially known causal relations. Run a suite of representative causal discovery methods (including constraint-based, score-based, and hybrid approaches) provided in each version using identical configurations and hyper-parameters. Employ (conditional) independence tests and score functions available in both versions to ensure consistency. Measure accuracy using metrics such as structural hamming distance, precision, recall, and F1 score, and evaluate scalability via runtime and memory profiling on datasets of varying sizes.\n Detailed experiment setup: \nPrepare datasets: (1) Synthetic datasets where the true causal graph is known, with various graph sizes and densities; (2) Real-world datasets such as those provided by causal-learn for benchmarking. For each dataset, execute all available methods from version 0.1.3.8 and from the newer version with updated algorithms. Use cross-validation or multiple runs to ensure statistical significance. Record performance metrics (accuracy-based measures for causal graph recovery and computational metrics for scalability). Also, leverage the utility functions for graph operations and dataset import described in the paper. Compare results across versions using tables and figures similar to those in Table 1 of the paper.",
            "expected_outcome": "The paper suggests ongoing active development; therefore, updating the library with newer algorithms should show improvements in terms of both recovery accuracy and computational efficiency when benchmarked on standard datasets."
