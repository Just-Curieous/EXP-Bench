      "hypothesis": "Will changing the score function configuration (for example, using generalized score functions vs. standard score functions) lead to improved recovery of the causal structure?",
      "method": "Use a score\u2010based causal discovery method (for example, Greedy Equivalence Search, GES) and vary its score function between a standard one (such as BIC or BDeu) and the generalized score function described by Huang et al. (2018).\n Detailed experiment setup: \nThe experiment design consists of the following steps: (1) Select a set of benchmark datasets that have been previously used in causal discovery (the causal-learn package provides several well\u2010tested benchmark datasets with partially known ground\u2010truth causal relations). The datasets should include synthetic data generated under various assumptions (e.g. Gaussian, non-Gaussian, and heteroscedastic noise settings) to cover different data distributions and functional relations. (2) Configure the GES algorithm twice: once with a standard score function (e.g. BIC or BDeu) and once with the generalized score function. (3) Run repeated experiments on each dataset, ensuring that all other configurations such as search space, intervention on initial graphs, and hyperparameters remain identical between the two configurations. (4) Evaluate the recovery of the underlying causal structure using relevant metrics such as the Structural Hamming Distance (SHD), precision, and recall of the recovered edges. (5) Compare the two configurations across different datasets and data generating processes. Relevant details from the paper indicate that while standard score functions output Markov equivalence classes, the generalized score function may better distinguish between different DAGs where functional causal models can be exploited.",
      "expected_outcome": "Given that the library provides multiple score functions refined through prior research, experiments should reveal that certain configurations (e.g., generalized score functions) yield higher accuracy in causal graph recovery under specific conditions.",

      "usage_instructions": "To compare standard score functions with generalized score functions for causal discovery using GES:\n\n1. Modify TestGES.py to create a new test method that runs GES with both standard and generalized score functions on the same datasets.\n2. For standard score functions, use 'local_score_BIC' (already implemented in test_ges_load_linear_10_with_local_score_BIC) or 'local_score_BDeu' (already implemented in test_ges_load_discrete_10_with_local_score_BDeu).\n3. For generalized score functions, add a new test using 'local_score_cv_general' or 'local_score_marginal_general' with the same datasets.\n4.
