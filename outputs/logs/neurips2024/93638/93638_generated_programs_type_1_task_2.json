    "no_answer": "The repository contains code for training models using the SPAG methodology (imitation learning, self-play episode collection, reward assignment, and reinforcement learning), but it does not include scripts that directly evaluate the models on the reasoning benchmarks mentioned in the experiment question (MMLU, BBH, ARC-e, ARC-c, Mutual, WinoGrande, LogiQA2, PIQA). According to the README.md, the evaluation is done using an external tool called 'lm-evaluation-harness' with setups described in their paper, but this tool and the specific evaluation scripts are not included in this repository. Therefore, there is no direct script in this repository that answers the experiment question about whether iterative self-play training with SPAG methodology leads to further improvements in reasoning performance over successive epochs."
