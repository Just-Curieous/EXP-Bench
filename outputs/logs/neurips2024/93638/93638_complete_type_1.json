The game will have 20 rounds.\n    Game rule descriptions to the adversarial games:\n        - An attacker and a defender perform a conversation around a target word only visible to the attacker. The attacker aims to induce the defender to speak out the target word unconsciously; the defender tries to avoid unconscious utterance of the target word and guess the word from the dialogue history. To win the adversarial game in information-limited conversations, both players are required to have high-level language capacities in terms of expression, upstanding, and reasoning. Moreover, by collecting target words from a vast vocabulary, this game can cover a broad range of topics providing sufficient language versatility. Besides, the game outcomes can be automatically and explicitly judged: we only need to check whether the target word appears in the defender\u2019s utterances (attacker wins) or its inference patterns (defender wins).\\",
