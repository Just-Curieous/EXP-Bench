    "no_answer": "While the repository contains the implementation of the SPAG methodology and scripts for training with different hyperparameters (train.py, tools/play_llm_game.py, tools/assign_rewards.py), there is no dedicated script or set of scripts that specifically performs the ablation study described in the experiment question. The repository provides the basic building blocks for training models with different hyperparameter values, but users would need to manually run these scripts multiple times with different parameter settings and then evaluate the results using an external tool (lm-evaluation-harness) which is not included in the repository. There is no automated workflow or script that systematically varies the imitation episode size, KL coefficients, and SFT coefficients to analyze their impact on reasoning performance as described in the experiment question."
