    "no_answer": "The repository contains the implementation of the SPAG method and shows in the README.md that it outperforms baseline methods on standard reasoning benchmarks in LLaMA-2-7B. However, there is no specific script in the repository that directly answers this experiment question. The repository mentions using the external 'lm-evaluation-harness' tool from EleutherAI for evaluation, but this tool is not included in the repository. The repository contains scripts for training SPAG models and collecting self-play episodes, but not for evaluating the models on reasoning benchmarks. To answer the experiment question, one would need to use the external 'lm-evaluation-harness' tool with the trained SPAG models, which requires additional setup and configuration not provided in this repository."
