However, for some models (e.g., Baichuan-2-13B), language-understanding metrics such as MMLU may slightly decline while overall performance (GM score) increases.\n\n- For LLaMA-2-7B, although the first-epoch SPAG model has a relatively lower performance than the imitation-learned (IM) model on WinoGrande, after an additional epoch of self-play iteration, SPAG-2 has achieved sufficient improvement to surpass the performance of the IM model. Considering the general language capability on MMLU, SPAG models cannot guarantee continuous improvement, especially for Baichuan-2-13B whose performance slightly decays during the SPAG training. Compared to the improvements in the reasoning benchmarks, this language-understanding decline is still within an acceptable range, since the overall performance (GM score) maintains increasing significantly.",

Focus on the following parameters: imitation data size, KL coefficients for imitation learning, and coefficients for self-play training.\n    - **Objective:** \n    Understand how each hyperparameter affects the performance of models trained using the SPAG methodology, particularly in terms of sample efficiency and reasoning improvements.\n\n2. **Testing Dataset:** \n    - Reasoning Benchmarks:\n        - MMLU\n        - BIG-Bench Hard (BBH)\n        - ARC Easy (ARC-e)\n        - ARC Challenge (ARC-c)\n        - Mutual\n        - WinoGrande\n        - LogiQA2\n        - PIQA\n\n3. **Abalation Study Parts:**  \n    - Imitation Data Size:\n        - Vary the imitation data size by collecting GPT-4 self-play episodes based on top-k frequency (with \ud835\udc58=1,2,3,5,10,15,20,30).\n        - Measure the geometric mean (GM) scores.\n        - Track the performance changes as the number of episodes increases, and identify the point at which gains plateau (around 5K episodes).\n\n    - KL Coefficient:\u03b21 in Imitation Learning:\n        - Test \u03b21 values within the range [0, 0.4]\n\n    - Self-Play Training Coefficients:\n        - Vary the supervised fine-tuning (SFT) coefficient (\u03b1) and the SPAG loss KL coefficient (\u03b22).\n        - Inspect performance variations.\n\n5. **Evaluation Metrics:**\n    - For overall performance: Geometric Mean (GM) of numerical scores across all benchmarks.\n\n6. **Hyperparamter:**\nFor hyperparameter undefined before, use the following: (If the question test on that hyperparamter, just ignore this part)\n    - For imitation learning,the learning rate is 5e-6 and the KL-penalty coefficient \u03b21 = 0.1.For SPAG training,the learning rate is 2e-6,the KL-penalty coefficient \u03b22=0.2,and the SFT coefficient \u03b1=0.5. For the Alpaca SFT baseline,we exactly follow the training setups of Alpaca and set the learning rate to 2e-6. Among all training stages,the batch size is 128 and the max sequence length is 2048.
