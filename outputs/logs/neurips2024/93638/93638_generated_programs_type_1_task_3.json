    "no_answer": "After thoroughly exploring the repository, I couldn't find any specific scripts that directly compare the adversarial game setup (SPAG) with non-adversarial setups like 20-Question and Guess-My-City. The repository contains code for training models using the SPAG approach (imitation learning followed by self-play), but it doesn't include scripts for evaluating and comparing different training regimes. The README.md mentions that they use the lm-evaluation-harness repository for reasoning benchmarks evaluation, but there are no specific scripts in this repository that would answer the experiment question directly. Additionally, I couldn't find any implementation or mention of the non-adversarial setups (20-Question and Guess-My-City) in the codebase."
