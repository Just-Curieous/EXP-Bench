      "question": "Does Voxel Mamba offer a favorable trade-off between detection accuracy, inference speed, and GPU memory usage relative to other architectures?",
      "method": "1. **Problem Setup:** \n    - **Task:** \n    Assess whether Voxel Mamba achieves an optimal balance between detection accuracy, inference speed, and GPU memory consumption compared to other 3D detection architectures.\n    - **Objective:** \n    Compare Voxel Mamba with DSVT, PV-RCNN++, CenterPoint-Pillar, and PointPillar to evaluate how it performs across different trade-off dimensions.\n\n2. **Testing Dataset:** \n    - Waymo Open Dataset\n        - Training set: 160k samples\n        - Validation set: 40k samples\n        - Testing set: 30k samples\n\n3. **Testing environment:**\n    - Hardware: NVIDIA A100 GPU\n    - Experimental Consistency:\n        -Use the same voxel sizes:\n            - Waymo: (0.32m, 0.32m, 0.1875m)\n    - Ensure identical evaluation conditions across all models\n\n4. **Comparative Evaluation:**  \n    - Models:\n        - Voxel Mamba (Proposed)\n        - DSVT\n        - PV-RCNN++\n        - CenterPoint-Pillar\n        - PointPillar\n\n5. **Architecture detail:**\n    - stack six DSB blocks, divided into three stages, for the Voxel Mamba backbone network. The downsampling rates for DSBs\u2019 backward branches in each stage are {1,2,4}.Specifically, we employ SpConv and its counterpart SpInverseConv as downsampling and upsampling operators in the DSB backward branch. \n    - a weight decay of 0.05, one-cycle learning rate policy,max learning rate of 0.004,and batch size of 32 for 20 epochs.\n\n\n6. **Evaluation Metrics:**\n    - Inference speed (measured in Frames Per Second (FPS))\n    - Detection accuracy\n        - Waymo: mAP @ L2\n    - GPU memory usage (in GB)",
      "expected_outcome": "Voxel Mamba is anticipated to achieve a favorable balance by significantly outperforming DSVT and PV-RCNN++ in detection accuracy while delivering competitive inference speeds and only a slight increase in GPU memory usage compared to faster but less accurate methods. The results should validate the claims that Voxel Mamba provides an optimal trade-off among speed, accuracy, and memory consumption as demonstrated in the experimental evaluations.",
