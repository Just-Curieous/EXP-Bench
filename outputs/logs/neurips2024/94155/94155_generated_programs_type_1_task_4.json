    "no_answer": "After a thorough examination of the repository, I couldn't find specific scripts or configuration files that directly answer the experiment question about the sequential addition of components (bidirectional SSMs, voxel conversion, DSB module, and IWP module) to the Centerpoint-Pillar baseline. The repository contains the implementation of the Voxel Mamba model with the DSB module, but it doesn't include specific ablation study scripts or configurations that would allow for the sequential evaluation of each component's contribution. Additionally, according to the README.md, the code for NuScenes dataset has not been released yet (marked as a TODO item: '[ ] Release code of NuScenes.'). While the model architecture components are present in the codebase, there are no ready-made scripts to run the specific ablation study described in the experiment question."
