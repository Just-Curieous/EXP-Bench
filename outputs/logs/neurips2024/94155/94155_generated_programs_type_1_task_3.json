    "no_answer": "While the paper mentions an experiment comparing different space-filling curves (Random, Window Partition, Z-order, Hilbert) in Table 6(a) showing their impact on 3D detection performance on nuScenes validation set, the repository does not contain specific scripts that directly implement this comparison. The repository includes code for generating Hilbert curves (/workspace/tools/hilbert_curves/create_hilbert_curve_template.py) and using them in the Voxel Mamba model (/workspace/pcdet/models/model_utils/voxel_mamba_utils.py), but there are no dedicated scripts for comparing different curve types. The repository appears to be incomplete as the README mentions 'Release code of NuScenes' as a TODO item, which would likely include the scripts for this experiment."
