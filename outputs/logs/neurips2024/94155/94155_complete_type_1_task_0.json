      "method": "1. **Problem Setup:** \n    - **Task:** \n    Compare the performance of Voxel Mamba and DSVT-based 3D backbones in object detection on the Waymo Open Dataset.\n    - **Objective:** \n    Determine whether the group-free serialization strategy of Voxel Mamba enhances 3D detection accuracy, as measured by Level 1 (L1) and Level 2 (L2) mAPH metrics.\n\n2. **Testing Dataset:** \n    Waymo Open Dataset(single frame setting)\n        - Training set: 160k samples\n        - Validation set: 40k samples\n        - Testing set: 30k samples\n3. **Comparative Evaluation:**  \n    - Models:\n        - DSVT-based backbone (Baseline model)\n        - Voxel Mamba backbone (Proposed model)\n    \n\n4. **Training Detail:**\n    - The voxel sizes are defined as (0.32m,0.32m,0.1875m) for Waymo and voxel features consist of 128channels.\n\n5. **Architecture detail:**\n    - stack six DSB blocks, divided into three stages, for the Voxel Mamba backbone network. The downsampling rates for DSBs\u2019 backward branches in each stage are {1,2,4}.Specifically, we employ SpConv and its counterpart SpInverseConv as downsampling and upsampling operators in the DSB backward branch. \n    - using Adam optimizer with weight decay 0.05,one-cycle learning rate policy,max learning rate 0.0025, and batch size 24 for 24 epochs\n\n6. **Detection Head & Loss Function:**\n    - Both models share the same BEV backbone from CenterPoint-Pillar\n\n7. **Evaluation Metrics:**\n    - Level 1 (L1) and Level 2 (L2) mAPH",

The templates should be saved as PyTorch files in a 'hilbert' directory.\n\n2. Implement a testing script that can evaluate 3D object detection models on the Waymo dataset. The script should:\n   - Accept command-line arguments for configuration file path and model checkpoint path\n   - Support distributed testing across multiple GPUs\n   - Load model configurations from YAML files\n   - Build the appropriate model architecture (either Voxel Mamba or DSVT) based on the configuration\n   - Load the specified model checkpoint\n   - Evaluate the model on the Waymo validation set\n   - Calculate and report Level 1 (L1) and Level 2 (L2) mAPH metrics\n\n3.
