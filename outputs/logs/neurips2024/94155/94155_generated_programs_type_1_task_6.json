    "no_answer": "After thoroughly examining the repository, I could not find scripts that directly compare the Integrative Weight Encoding (IWE) method with other positional embedding approaches (absolute position encoding and sin/cos embeddings) on the nuScenes validation set. While the repository contains a Voxel Mamba model implementation with positional encoding capabilities (in pcdet/models/backbones_3d/voxel_mamba_waymo.py) and a PositionEmbeddingLearned class (in pcdet/models/model_utils/dsvt_utils.py), there are no specific scripts or configurations that set up the comparative experiment described in the question. The repository focuses on the Voxel Mamba model implementation but does not include explicit ablation studies comparing different positional encoding methods as specified in the experiment question."
