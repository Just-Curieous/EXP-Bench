Additionally, converting pillars to voxels enhances the detector's performance by removing group size constraints, allowing for better spatial representation.  Voxel Mamba, when integrated with the Dual-scale SSM Block (DSB), achieves superior performance compared to plain bidirectional SSMs. This improvement is attributed to DSB's ability to construct larger effective receptive fields (ERFs) and mitigate the loss of spatial proximity.Furthermore, the Iterative Window Encoding (IWE) module further enhances Voxel Mamba\u2019s performance by effectively capturing 3D positional information and improving voxel proximity.
