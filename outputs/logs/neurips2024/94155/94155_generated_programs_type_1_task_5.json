    "no_answer": "The repository does not contain ready-made scripts that directly answer the experiment question about different downsampling rate configurations in the DSB module. According to the README.md, the code for nuScenes is not yet released (it's listed as a TODO item). While the repository contains the implementation of the Voxel Mamba model with the DSB module in `/workspace/pcdet/models/backbones_3d/voxel_mamba_waymo.py` and the downsampling rate configurations are specified in the model configuration files (particularly in the `down_stride` parameter), there are no specific scripts or configuration files that evaluate the different downsampling configurations ({1,1,1}, {1,2,2}, {2,2,2}, {4,4,4}, {1,2,4}) on the nuScenes validation set as required by the experiment question. The existing test.py and train.py scripts provide the infrastructure for training and evaluating models, but they would need to be used with custom configuration files for each downsampling rate variant, which are not provided in the repository."
