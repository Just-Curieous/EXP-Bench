The method includes non-core components such as problem setup, testing dataset, comparative evaluation, and evaluation metrics, which involve initializing, training, and evaluating models. These steps are orchestration and support logic rather than implementing the core idea. The architecture detail and training detail are mostly non-core, as they describe the use of existing methods such as SpConv and learning rate policies. However, there is ambiguity in the architecture detail regarding the implementation specifics of the DSB blocks and their integration with Voxel Mamba. Therefore, one non-core component is marked as ambiguous due to the lack of provided scripts and specific implementation details."

Additionally, converting pillars to voxels enhances the detector's performance by removing group size constraints, allowing for better spatial representation.  Voxel Mamba, when integrated with the Dual-scale SSM Block (DSB), achieves superior performance compared to plain bidirectional SSMs. This improvement is attributed to DSB's ability to construct larger effective receptive fields (ERFs) and mitigate the loss of spatial proximity.Furthermore, the Iterative Window Encoding (IWE) module further enhances Voxel Mamba\u2019s performance by effectively capturing 3D positional information and improving voxel proximity.

The ablation experiment steps and comparative evaluation using different downsampling rates are primarily orchestration tasks as they involve applying the model and assessing configurations rather than implementing the novel model itself. The problem setup, testing dataset, and evaluation metrics are non-core components, serving to execute and assess the experiment rather than contribute to the core idea. The core components likely involve implementing the Voxel Mamba model and the Dual-scale SSM Block, specifically the logic for handling downsampling configurations and assessing their impact on spatial encoding. There is ambiguity in the implementation details of the Dual-scale SSM Block (DSB) and its interaction with downsampling rates, as these are crucial for the novel contribution but not clearly detailed.

The script requires several steps, such as importing libraries, parsing command-line arguments, initializing datasets, building the model, loading pre-trained weights, running inference, and visualizing results. These steps are largely orchestration tasks that involve using the pre-trained Voxel Mamba model rather than implementing its core logic. Specifically, steps like loading the model, preparing it for inference, processing data, and visualization are non-core as they do not involve implementing the novel SSM-based method. The core component is building the 3D object detection network according to the configuration (Step 5), as it directly involves the Voxel Mamba model's structure. No steps are ambiguous since the detailed requirements provide clear guidance on what each step involves."
