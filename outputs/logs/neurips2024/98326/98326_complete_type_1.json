      "method": "Design an experiment comparing MAML training on the Omniglot dataset using two setups: one with sequential training on a single GPU and one with distributed training using TorchOpt on 8 GPUs.\n Detailed experiment setup: \nThe experiment will implement MAML (Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning) on the Omniglot dataset. Two training setups will be established: (1) a sequential setup running on a single GPU using standard TorchOpt training, and (2) a distributed setup using TorchOpt with 8 GPUs coordinated by a central controller via RPC, as described in the paper. Both setups will use the same hyperparameters, optimizer settings (e.g., Adam optimizer), and training procedures. The training process will monitor both training accuracy and wall time over a series of iterations (e.g., up to 2000 iterations). The key evaluation metrics will be the convergence of training accuracy (comparing the training accuracy curves) and the total wall time required to achieve similar accuracy levels. The figures in the paper (especially Figure 7) provide comparative training curves and wall time plots to validate the experiment.",
