    "no_answer": "After a thorough search of the repository, I couldn't find any scripts that specifically benchmark OpTree for tree flatten operations compared to JAX XLA, PyTorch, and DM-Tree across different network scales as described in the experiment question. The README mentions that OpTree is a separate open-source project at https://github.com/metaopt/optree, which suggests that the benchmarking scripts might be in that repository rather than in this one. The current repository (TorchOpt) uses OpTree as a dependency but doesn't contain the benchmarking code that would answer the specific experiment question about comparing tree flatten operations across different implementations and network scales."
