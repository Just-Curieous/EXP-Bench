            "method": "Design an experiment comparing MAML training on the Omniglot dataset using two setups: one with sequential training on a single GPU and one with distributed training using TorchOpt on 8 GPUs.\n Detailed experiment setup: \nThe experiment will implement MAML (Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning) on the Omniglot dataset. Two training setups will be established: (1) a sequential setup running on a single GPU using standard TorchOpt training, and (2) a distributed setup using TorchOpt with 8 GPUs coordinated by a central controller via RPC, as described in the paper. Both setups will use the same hyperparameters, optimizer settings (e.g., Adam optimizer), and training procedures. The training process will monitor both training accuracy and wall time over a series of iterations (e.g., up to 2000 iterations). The key evaluation metrics will be the convergence of training accuracy (comparing the training accuracy curves) and the total wall time required to achieve similar accuracy levels. The figures in the paper (especially Figure 7) provide comparative training curves and wall time plots to validate the experiment.",

Both scripts implement MAML on the Omniglot dataset with the same hyperparameters and will output training accuracy and wall time metrics.

In particular, the experiment will run the tree-map function repeatedly on dummy trees generated from these models and record the execution time (in milliseconds) for each architecture. Speedup ratios will be computed relative to the baseline implementations.\n Detailed experiment setup: \n1. Models: Use networks including AlexNet, ResNet18, ResNet34, ResNet50, ResNet101, ResNet152, Swin-B, and ViT-H/14 to represent a variety of architectures. \n2. Tree Construction: For each model, extract its nested parameter structure (PyTree). Use identical dummy tensors with appropriate shapes to ensure a fair comparison. \n3. Implementations: Implement the tree map operation using (a) TorchOpt\u2019s OpTree, (b) JAX XLA\u2019s utility, (c) standard PyTorch routines, and (d) DM-Tree. \n4. Scalability: Vary the number of nodes within the trees (ranging from small to as high as 5000 nodes) to observe the performance trend as the tree scale increases. \n5. Measurement: Execute each tree-map operation on both CPU and GPU environments where available, and measure the average time cost over multiple runs for statistical reliability. \n6. Evaluation: Plot the time cost versus the number of nodes (similar to Figures 8, 9, and 10 in the paper) and compute speedup ratios (as shown in Table 2 for tree map operations).",

Select models such as ResNet18 and ResNet50 to cover different scales, aligning with the scale experiments reported (e.g., see Table 2 for tree operation speedups and Fig. 5 for forward/backward times).\n2. Experimental Setup: \n   - Implement two training pipelines: one using TorchOpt's explicit gradient API which reuses intermediate data during back-propagation, and one using the standard PyTorch autograd for gradient computation.\n   - Ensure both pipelines use identical optimizer settings (e.g., Adam, with the same learning rate, batch size, and parameter initialization). \n   - Execute the experiments on both CPU and GPU (using the accelerated implementations written in C++ OpenMP and CUDA bound via pybind11 as noted in the paper) to evaluate performance.\n   - Record the forward and backward pass times for different model sizes and parameter scales as in Fig. 5 of the paper.\n3. Numerical Stability Measurement:\n   - During training, monitor the evolution of the loss and the gradient norms. \n   - Optionally, compare gradient values computed by both methods (or against an analytical approximation if available) to assess the impact of reusing intermediate data on numerical accuracy.\n4. Additional Considerations:\n   - Run multiple trials to account for variance and perform statistical analysis.\n   - Optionally, include a distributed setting as demonstrated in the paper (Fig. 5(c)) to observe linear speedup behavior when scaling the number of GPU workers.\n   - Utilize high-performance PyTree utilities (OpTree) provided by TorchOpt to optimize memory management during tree flatten/unflatten operations, resembling the configurations used in the paper's performance evaluations.",
