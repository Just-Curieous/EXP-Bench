    "no_answer": "After thoroughly exploring the repository, I couldn't find a specific script or set of scripts that directly answer the experiment question about comparing TorchOpt's explicit gradient differentiation API with standard autograd implementations in terms of computation time and numerical stability. While the repository contains accelerated operations (/workspace/torchopt/accelerated_op/) and test files that compare accelerated and non-accelerated implementations (/workspace/tests/test_accelerated_op.py), there isn't a comprehensive benchmark script that specifically measures computation time and numerical stability differences between TorchOpt's explicit gradient API and standard PyTorch autograd as described in the experiment question. The repository has examples of using TorchOpt's explicit gradient API and accelerated operations, but not in the controlled comparison setup required by the experiment."
