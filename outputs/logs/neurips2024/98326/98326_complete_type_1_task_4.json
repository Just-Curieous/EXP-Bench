      "hypothesis": "Does fusing operations within the Adam optimizer (as done in TorchOpt) result in a less complex and more interpretable gradient graph compared to the output from TorchViz?",
      "method": "Run a controlled MAML meta-learning experiment using the Adam optimizer and compare the gradient graph visualization produced by TorchOpt with that produced by TorchViz. The plan is to use the same network architecture, dataset (e.g., Omniglot or another standard meta-learning dataset), and training configuration so that the only difference is in the gradient graph visualization tools. The experiment involves executing one training iteration where the Adam optimizer is applied and then visualizing the backward computational graph with both TorchViz and TorchOpt.\n Detailed experiment setup: \n1. Use a MAML setup with a standard meta-learning dataset (e.g., Omniglot) and a typical network architecture. Configure the Adam optimizer with standard hyperparameters. \n2. Execute one or more training iterations using the same model and optimizer across two experiments. \n3. In one experiment, extract the gradient graph using TorchViz which outputs a detailed graph showing each individual backward operation (e.g., AddBackward0, TBackward0, etc.). \n4. In the other experiment, use TorchOpt\u2019s visualization tool where the internal operations of Adam (such as Add, Div, Mul, etc.) are fused into a single node (represented as an orange node as described in the paper) to reduce node complexity and provide annotated variable names. \n5. Compare the two visualizations side-by-side (similar to Figure 3 in the paper) with a focus on overall complexity (number of nodes and edges) and interpretability (ease of identifying variable names and operation groups). \n6. Record and analyze the differences using the provided metrics such as node count and clarity of operation grouping. Additional settings such as CPU/GPU acceleration, distributed inner-loop dispatching, and high-performance PyTree operations can also be incorporated based on the detailed descriptions in the paper to observe any impact on optimization performance.",
      "expected_outcome": "The paper indicates that by fusing operations, the gradient graph complexity is reduced, which should be observable in reduced node counts and more straightforward visualizations when comparing TorchOpt to TorchViz.",

      "usage_instructions": "Execute the script with 'python /workspace/examples/visualize.py'. This will generate two visualization files: 'torchviz_graph.svg' showing the gradient graph from TorchViz and 'torchopt_graph.svg' showing the gradient graph from TorchOpt with fused Adam operations. The script creates a simple neural network, applies the Adam optimizer, and visualizes the computational graph for both TorchViz and TorchOpt, allowing direct comparison of their complexity and interpretability as described in the experiment question.",

        "Step 1: Import necessary libraries including torch, torch.nn, torch.nn.functional, torchviz, and torchopt (/workspace/examples/visualize.py:16-21)",

        "Step 4: Define a function to create and visualize a computational graph using TorchOpt with fused operations: initialize the network, create an accelerated Adam optimizer, perform forward pass, calculate loss, extract network state with visual tracking enabled, apply optimizer step, extract updated network state, and generate visualization (/workspace/examples/visualize.py:50-71)",
        "Step 5: In the main execution block, set dimension and batch size parameters, then call both visualization functions to generate the comparison graphs (/workspace/examples/visualize.py:74-78)"

      "agent_instructions": "Create a script that compares the computational graph visualization between standard PyTorch (TorchViz) and TorchOpt with fused Adam operations. The script should:\n\n1. Create a simple neural network with a linear layer that takes an input tensor and a meta parameter\n\n2. Implement two visualization functions:\n   - One using standard TorchViz to visualize the computational graph with a regular Adam optimizer\n   - One using TorchOpt to visualize the computational graph with fused Adam operations\n\n3. For each visualization function:\n   - Initialize the network and move it to CUDA\n   - Set up the appropriate optimizer (standard vs. accelerated)\n   - Perform a forward pass with dummy data\n   - Calculate a loss (MSE)\n   - Apply an optimizer step\n   - Generate a visualization of the computational graph\n\n4. For the TorchOpt visualization specifically:\n   - Extract the network state with visual tracking enabled before and after the optimizer step\n   - Use these states when generating the visualization\n\n5. When executed, the script should generate two SVG files:\n   - 'torchviz_graph.svg' showing the standard PyTorch computational graph\n   - 'torchopt_graph.svg' showing the TorchOpt computational graph with fused operations\n\nThe goal is to demonstrate how TorchOpt's visualization provides a clearer representation of the computational graph compared to standard TorchViz.",
