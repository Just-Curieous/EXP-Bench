            "hypothesis": "Does distributed training using TorchOpt on 8 GPUs achieve similar training accuracy as sequential training on 1 GPU while significantly reducing wall time?",
            "method": "Design an experiment comparing MAML training on the Omniglot dataset using two setups: one with sequential training on a single GPU and one with distributed training using TorchOpt on 8 GPUs.\n Detailed experiment setup: \nThe experiment will implement MAML (Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning) on the Omniglot dataset. Two training setups will be established: (1) a sequential setup running on a single GPU using standard TorchOpt training, and (2) a distributed setup using TorchOpt with 8 GPUs coordinated by a central controller via RPC, as described in the paper. Both setups will use the same hyperparameters, optimizer settings (e.g., Adam optimizer), and training procedures. The training process will monitor both training accuracy and wall time over a series of iterations (e.g., up to 2000 iterations). The key evaluation metrics will be the convergence of training accuracy (comparing the training accuracy curves) and the total wall time required to achieve similar accuracy levels. The figures in the paper (especially Figure 7) provide comparative training curves and wall time plots to validate the experiment.",
            "expected_outcome": "Based on the paper, the distributed approach should yield comparable training accuracy to sequential training but with markedly reduced training wall time (as seen in the MAML Omniglot experiments)."

            "hypothesis": "Will using OpTree for tree flatten operations result in significant speedup compared to JAX XLA, PyTorch, and DM-Tree across different network scales?",
            "method": "Benchmarking tree flatten operations using different PyTree utility implementations (OpTree, JAX XLA, PyTorch, and DM-Tree) across varied deep network architectures.\n Detailed experiment setup: \nDesign an experiment that measures the time cost of performing tree flatten operations on nested data structures derived from several neural network models. Use models such as ResNet18, ResNet50, and ResNet152 (as in Table 2) as well as additional networks like AlexNet, ResNet34, Swin-B, etc. (as referenced in Figures 8 and 9) to cover a range of network scales and complexity. For each model, construct a PyTree that mimics the nested structure of its parameters. Then, for a controlled set of tree sizes (e.g., varying the number of nodes from 0 up to 5000, as shown in Figure 8), run the tree flatten operation with each of the four implementations (OpTree, JAX XLA, PyTorch, DM-Tree) while keeping the environment and hardware (CPU/GPU, with C++ OpenMP and CUDA acceleration for OpTree) constant. Record the execution times and compute the speedup ratios between the baselines and OpTree. The implementation should reuse intermediate data during back-propagation to mimic real-world differentiable optimization scenarios. Use pybind11 to integrate C++ accelerated functions within Python for consistency across measurements.",
            "expected_outcome": "The experiments (e.g., Figure 8 and Table 2) suggest that OpTree can provide speedups up to 27.31x for tree flatten operations on models like ResNet50, indicating a strong performance advantage over the compared libraries."

The plan is to construct nested parameter trees from several common deep networks (AlexNet, ResNet variants, Swin-B, and ViT) and measure the operation\u2019s runtime as the tree scale increases. In particular, the experiment will run the tree-map function repeatedly on dummy trees generated from these models and record the execution time (in milliseconds) for each architecture. Speedup ratios will be computed relative to the baseline implementations.\n Detailed experiment setup: \n1. Models: Use networks including AlexNet, ResNet18, ResNet34, ResNet50, ResNet101, ResNet152, Swin-B, and ViT-H/14 to represent a variety of architectures. \n2. Tree Construction: For each model, extract its nested parameter structure (PyTree). Use identical dummy tensors with appropriate shapes to ensure a fair comparison. \n3. Implementations: Implement the tree map operation using (a) TorchOpt\u2019s OpTree, (b) JAX XLA\u2019s utility, (c) standard PyTorch routines, and (d) DM-Tree. \n4. Scalability: Vary the number of nodes within the trees (ranging from small to as high as 5000 nodes) to observe the performance trend as the tree scale increases. \n5. Measurement: Execute each tree-map operation on both CPU and GPU environments where available, and measure the average time cost over multiple runs for statistical reliability. \n6. Evaluation: Plot the time cost versus the number of nodes (similar to Figures 8, 9, and 10 in the paper) and compute speedup ratios (as shown in Table 2 for tree map operations).",

The experiment involves training deep neural network models with both approaches under equivalent conditions to measure computation time and numerical stability.\n Detailed experiment setup: \n1. Dataset & Models: Use a standard image classification dataset (e.g., CIFAR-10 or ImageNet). Select models such as ResNet18 and ResNet50 to cover different scales, aligning with the scale experiments reported (e.g., see Table 2 for tree operation speedups and Fig. 5 for forward/backward times).\n2. Experimental Setup: \n   - Implement two training pipelines: one using TorchOpt's explicit gradient API which reuses intermediate data during back-propagation, and one using the standard PyTorch autograd for gradient computation.\n   - Ensure both pipelines use identical optimizer settings (e.g., Adam, with the same learning rate, batch size, and parameter initialization). \n   - Execute the experiments on both CPU and GPU (using the accelerated implementations written in C++ OpenMP and CUDA bound via pybind11 as noted in the paper) to evaluate performance.\n   - Record the forward and backward pass times for different model sizes and parameter scales as in Fig. 5 of the paper.\n3. Numerical Stability Measurement:\n   - During training, monitor the evolution of the loss and the gradient norms. \n   - Optionally, compare gradient values computed by both methods (or against an analytical approximation if available) to assess the impact of reusing intermediate data on numerical accuracy.\n4. Additional Considerations:\n   - Run multiple trials to account for variance and perform statistical analysis.\n   - Optionally, include a distributed setting as demonstrated in the paper (Fig. 5(c)) to observe linear speedup behavior when scaling the number of GPU workers.\n   - Utilize high-performance PyTree utilities (OpTree) provided by TorchOpt to optimize memory management during tree flatten/unflatten operations, resembling the configurations used in the paper's performance evaluations.",

The plan is to use the same network architecture, dataset (e.g., Omniglot or another standard meta-learning dataset), and training configuration so that the only difference is in the gradient graph visualization tools. The experiment involves executing one training iteration where the Adam optimizer is applied and then visualizing the backward computational graph with both TorchViz and TorchOpt.\n Detailed experiment setup: \n1. Use a MAML setup with a standard meta-learning dataset (e.g., Omniglot) and a typical network architecture. Configure the Adam optimizer with standard hyperparameters. \n2. Execute one or more training iterations using the same model and optimizer across two experiments. \n3. In one experiment, extract the gradient graph using TorchViz which outputs a detailed graph showing each individual backward operation (e.g., AddBackward0, TBackward0, etc.). \n4. In the other experiment, use TorchOpt\u2019s visualization tool where the internal operations of Adam (such as Add, Div, Mul, etc.) are fused into a single node (represented as an orange node as described in the paper) to reduce node complexity and provide annotated variable names. \n5. Compare the two visualizations side-by-side (similar to Figure 3 in the paper) with a focus on overall complexity (number of nodes and edges) and interpretability (ease of identifying variable names and operation groups). \n6. Record and analyze the differences using the provided metrics such as node count and clarity of operation grouping. Additional settings such as CPU/GPU acceleration, distributed inner-loop dispatching, and high-performance PyTree operations can also be incorporated based on the detailed descriptions in the paper to observe any impact on optimization performance.",
