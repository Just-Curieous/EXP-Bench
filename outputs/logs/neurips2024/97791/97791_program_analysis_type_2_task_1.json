  "agent_instructions": "Your task is to create a script that classifies supernovae types using wavelet features extracted from light curves. Follow these steps:\n\n1. Load a dataset of supernova light curves from the Multimodal Universe collection.\n\n2. Clean and preprocess the light curve data by:\n   - Removing padding (zero values)\n   - Clipping the light curves around the peak brightness\n   - Normalizing the time axis\n   - Standardizing filter names\n   - Filtering out objects with insufficient observations\n\n3. Group supernova types into major categories (Ia, II, Ibc, other) for classification purposes.\n\n4. Extract wavelet features from the light curves using the WaveletFeatures class from the snmachine library.\n\n5. Visualize the feature space using t-SNE to see how well different supernova types separate in the feature space.\n\n6. Train multiple classifiers on the wavelet features. You should implement at least three different classification algorithms such as SVM, Random Forest, and Boosted Decision Trees.\n\n7. Evaluate the classifiers using appropriate metrics such as accuracy and confusion matrices.\n\n8. Plot ROC curves to visualize classifier performance.\n\n9. Save the classification results and visualizations to files.\n\nThe script should use the snmachine library which provides tools for supernova light curve analysis, feature extraction, and classification. Make sure to handle cases where objects have missing or invalid data."
