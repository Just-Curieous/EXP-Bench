    "no_answer": "After thoroughly exploring the repository, I couldn't find a specific script or set of scripts that directly answer the experiment question about adjusting training hyperparameters for the PLAsTiCC dataset. While the repository contains baseline models (/workspace/baselines/plasticc/) with a configuration file (plasticc_config.yml) that defines some model architecture parameters, there isn't a dedicated script for systematically varying hyperparameters such as learning rates, training steps/epochs, and learning rate schedules as specified in the experiment question. The repository primarily focuses on data processing, dataset creation, and baseline model definitions rather than hyperparameter tuning experiments."
