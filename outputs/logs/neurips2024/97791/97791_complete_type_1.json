      "question": "Will the inclusion of both image data (specifically, images from Legacy Surveys DR10 as provided in the Multimodal Universe dataset) and spectral data (from DESI) improve the performance of galaxy morphology classification compared to using only a single modality?",
      "method": "We propose to use a contrastive learning approach based on the AstroCLIP framework to train joint embeddings from the two modalities. The experiment involves building a cross\u2010matched dataset by pairing galaxies with both image and spectral data (images from Legacy Surveys DR10 and spectra from DESI, as available in the Multimodal Universe dataset). Train the joint embedding network using the same hyperparameter settings and training suite as described in AstroCLIP. Three models will be trained: one using only the image data, one using only the spectral data, and one using the combined multimodal data. A k-Nearest Neighbor classifier (with k = 16) will be used on the learned embeddings to perform galaxy morphology classification, and the performance (e.g., accuracy, F1 score) on the held-out 20% test set will be compared across these models.",
