    "no_answer": "After thoroughly exploring the repository, I found that the planning pipeline in nuPlan is explicitly marked as a TODO item in the README.md file. The repository currently only contains the prediction part of BeTopNet implemented for the Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD). There is a mention of a 'Scenario Token released for Test14-Inter' with a link to a YAML file, but this is just a configuration file, not the full implementation. The README also states 'Full code and checkpoints release is coming soon. Please stay tuned.' There are no scripts, notebooks, or code related to nuPlan, Test14 benchmarks, or the planning experiments described in the experiment question. Therefore, the repository does not currently contain the scripts needed to replicate the interactive planning experiments on the nuPlan dataset as described in the experiment question."
