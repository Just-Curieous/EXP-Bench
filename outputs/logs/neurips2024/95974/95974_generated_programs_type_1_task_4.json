    "no_answer": "After thoroughly exploring the repository, I found that the planning pipeline for nuPlan is not yet released. The README explicitly states 'Full code and checkpoints release is coming soon' and lists 'Planning pipeline in nuPlan' as an uncompleted TODO item. The repository currently only contains the prediction pipeline for the Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD), with no scripts related to nuPlan, planning, or ablation studies. Therefore, there are no scripts in the repository that can answer the experiment question about BeTopNet's component ablation study on the nuPlan dataset using Test14 benchmarks."
