      "hypothesis": "BeTopNet\u2019s topological formulations significantly improve interactive planning performance over existing planning systems in both hard and general driving scenarios.",
      "method": "Replicate the interactive planning experiments on the nuPlan dataset using the provided Test14 benchmarks and simulation protocols as described in the paper. Set up experiments for three different simulation scenarios: open-loop (OL) planning tests where the open-loop score (OLS) is computed using displacement and miss rate metrics; closed-loop non-reactive (CL-NR) simulations; and reactive (Test14-Inter) simulations. Use the same test splits (Test14-Hard, Test14-Random, and Test14-Inter) and follow the detailed evaluation protocol that measures metrics such as average planning score, driving safety (e.g., CA and TTC), driving progress, comfort, and compliance (e.g., DDC) as well as the aggregated PDMScore metric. The simulation environment should replicate the exact settings of the paper, including the multi-step reduction training strategy and evaluation procedures. Training should be performed on 4 NVIDIA A100 GPUs using the AdamW optimizer with a learning rate of 1e-4 and a multi-step reduction schedule. The planning model should be trained for 25 epochs with a batch size of 128, while the prediction module should be trained for 30 epochs with a batch size of 256. Document all percentage improvements compared to baseline methods\u2014these include learning-based, rule-based, and hybrid planners\u2014with reference to performance improvements observed in Tables 2 and 3 and qualitative results shown in Figures 7 to 10. For instance, the evaluation should capture improvements in closed-loop simulation scores (e.g., a CLS gain of approximately +4.6%), enhanced driving safety (e.g., +2.7% in CA and +1.0% in TTC), and better compliance (+2.8% in DDC) under hard-case scenarios, as well as consistent improvements in general cases.",
      "expected_outcome": "Experiments should demonstrate that BeTopNet achieves a statistically significant improvement over existing planning systems. Expected outcomes include a marked gain in performance metrics such as approximately +7.9% improvement in hard-case planning scores, around +6.2% improvement in closed-loop non-reactive simulation scores, and notable enhancements in reactive simulation scenarios. Detailed metrics should show improved values in driving safety (e.g., higher CA and TTC scores), driving progress, comfort, and compliance (e.g., higher DDC), thereby validating the hypothesis that the topological formulation of BeTopNet leads to superior interactive planning performance.",

The README also states 'Full code and checkpoints release is coming soon. Please stay tuned.'
