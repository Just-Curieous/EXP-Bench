  "agent_instructions": "Your task is to implement a training pipeline for the BeTopNet model on the Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD) for autonomous vehicle trajectory prediction. The implementation should include the following components:\n\n1. A training script that:\n   - Loads and processes the Waymo Open Motion Dataset\n   - Builds the BeTopNet model architecture\n   - Implements a training loop with appropriate loss functions\n   - Supports distributed training across multiple GPUs\n   - Saves checkpoints and logs training progress\n   - Evaluates the model on a validation set\n\n2. A configuration file that specifies:\n   - Dataset parameters (paths, object types, sampling intervals)\n   - Model architecture (encoder/decoder structure, attention layers)\n   - Training hyperparameters (batch size, learning rate, optimizer)\n\n3. A shell script wrapper for launching distributed training\n\nThe BeTopNet model should be trained to predict future trajectories of vehicles, pedestrians, and cyclists. The model architecture consists of an encoder that processes agent and map features, and a decoder that generates multi-modal trajectory predictions.\n\nAfter training, the model should be evaluated on the validation set using metrics such as Average Displacement Error (ADE) and Final Displacement Error (FDE).\n\nEnsure that the training pipeline supports:\n- Loading pretrained models or resuming from checkpoints\n- TensorBoard logging for monitoring training progress\n- Configurable batch size and number of epochs\n- Learning rate scheduling\n\nThe training should be run with the appropriate configuration to achieve good performance on the trajectory prediction task."
