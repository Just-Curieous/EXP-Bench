            "question": "Do geometric deep learning models (PointNet, GCNN, and RegDGCNN) exhibit different predictive accuracies for aerodynamic drag when applied on datasets with varying car design complexities?",
            "method": "Train the three models using PyTorch and PyTorch Geometric on two aerodynamic drag datasets. For the first experiment, use the DrivAerNet dataset comprising 4,000 car designs with a split of 2,800 for training, approximately 600 for validation, and 600 for testing. For the second experiment, use the DrivAerNet++ dataset consisting of 8,000 car designs with 5,600 for training, 1,200 for validation, and 1,200 for testing. Employ both graph-based and point cloud representations in training. Evaluate the models by computing metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Maximum Absolute Error (Max AE), R2 score, training time, inference time, and number of parameters. Consider design variations like detailed versus smooth underbodies, open versus closed wheel configurations, and different rear design configurations, and analyze how these affect drag predictions.",
            "expected_outcome": "The results should show that models have competitive yet varying performance across datasets. On DrivAerNet, RegDGCNN is expected to yield the lowest MSE and highest R2 score, while on DrivAerNet++, the increased design diversity is anticipated to challenge all models and produce more variation in error metrics, thereby highlighting the sensitivity of model performance to design complexity.",

            "question": "Does the predictive performance of surrogate models based on parametric data improve with increased training set size and differ across model architectures in aerodynamic drag prediction?",
            "method": "Utilize an AutoML framework optimized with Bayesian hyperparameter tuning to train models such as Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, LightGBM, and Random Forests on aerodynamic drag prediction using 26 design parameters. Conduct two sets of experiments: one on a single car design (fastback) and another on a combined dataset (fastback, notchback, and estateback). For both experiments, split the dataset into 80% for training and 20% for testing, and subdivide the training set into 20%, 40%, 60%, 80%, and 100% portions. Measure performance using R2 score and assess how performance evolves with data scale, noting that XGBoost, for example, is expected to show an increase in R2 score from approximately 0.35 to 0.55 as the training data increases.",
            "expected_outcome": "It is expected that all the surrogate models will perform better with an increase in training set size, with the AutoML framework revealing model-specific strengths. The paper indicates that AutoGluon performs well in the single-design scenario, whereas LightGBM excels on the combined dataset, thereby confirming the benefit of enlarging the training data and the influence of model architecture on prediction accuracy.",
