      "question": "Does the predictive performance of surrogate models based on parametric data improve with increased training set size and differ across model architectures in aerodynamic drag prediction? This experiment uses aerodynamic car designs characterized by 26 parameters\u2014as provided in the DrivAerNet++ dataset, which includes diverse configurations such as fastback, notchback, and estateback\u2014for assessing performance scalability and model-specific behavior.",
      "method": "Utilize an AutoML framework optimized with Bayesian hyperparameter tuning to train models such as Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, LightGBM, and Random Forests on aerodynamic drag prediction using the 26 design parameters. The experiment involves performing two sets of trials: one with a single car design (fastback) and another with a combined dataset including fastback, notchback, and estateback configurations, as featured in the DrivAerNet++ dataset. In both scenarios, split the data into 80% for training and 20% for testing, and further subdivide the training set into portions of 20%, 40%, 60%, 80%, and 100%. The evaluation metric is the R2 score, to observe how performance scales with increasing training data and differs by model architecture.",
      "expected_outcome": "It is expected that all the surrogate models will perform better with an increase in training set size, with the AutoML framework revealing model-specific strengths. The paper indicates that AutoGluon performs well in the single-design scenario, whereas LightGBM excels on the combined dataset, thereby confirming the benefit of enlarging the training data and the influence of model architecture on prediction accuracy.",

      "usage_instructions": "Execute the AutoML_parametric.py script with the correct path to the parametric data file. The script needs to be modified slightly to point to the correct location of the DrivAerNet_ParametricData.csv file. Change line 331 from 'file_path = '../ParametricData/DrivAerNet_ParametricData.csv'' to 'file_path = '/workspace/ParametricModels/DrivAerNet_ParametricData.csv''. The script will then load the data, train multiple surrogate models (AutoGluon, XGBoost, LightGBM, RandomForest, and GradientBoosting) on different training set sizes, evaluate their performance using R\u00b2 score, and generate visualizations showing how model performance scales with increasing training data size for both the fastback-only and combined datasets.",
