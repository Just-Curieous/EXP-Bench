      "question": "Do geometric deep learning models (PointNet, GCNN, and RegDGCNN) exhibit differential predictive accuracies for aerodynamic drag when applied to aerodynamic datasets with varying car design complexities, including differences in underbody details (detailed vs. smooth), wheel configurations (open vs. closed), and distinct rear design configurations? (Note: The evaluation involves datasets that incorporate diverse car configurations, as seen in DrivAerNet++ with detailed point cloud, mesh, and CFD simulation data.)",
      "method": "Train the three models using PyTorch and PyTorch Geometric on two datasets: DrivAerNet (4,000 car designs with splits of 2,800 for training, roughly 600 for validation, and 600 for testing) and DrivAerNet++ (8,000 car designs split into 5,600 for training, 1,200 for validation, and 1,200 for testing). Use both graph-based and point cloud representations during training. Evaluate the models using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Maximum Absolute Error (Max AE), R2 score, training time, inference time, and the number of parameters. Analyze how different design variations (e.g., underbody details, wheel configurations, rear design structures) impact predictive performance.",
      "expected_outcome": "It is anticipated that while all models will demonstrate competitive performance, distinct differences in accuracy will be observed. In the DrivAerNet dataset, RegDGCNN is expected to achieve the lowest MSE and highest R2 score. In contrast, the enhanced complexity and diversity of the DrivAerNet++ dataset are likely to challenge all models, leading to greater variation in error metrics and highlighting the sensitivity of geometric deep learning techniques to design complexity.",

      "usage_instructions": "To evaluate the differential predictive accuracies of geometric deep learning models (PointNet, GCNN, and RegDGCNN) on aerodynamic drag prediction across varying car design complexities:\n\n1. First, train the Graph Convolutional Neural Network (GCNN) model using:\n   ```\n   cd /workspace/DeepSurrogates\n   python train_GNN.py\n   ```\n   This script trains the DragGNN_XL model on the DrivAerNet++ dataset (8,000 car designs) using graph-based representations.\n\n2. Next, train the PointNet model using:\n   ```\n   cd /workspace/DeepSurrogates\n   python train_RegPointNet.py\n   ```\n   This script trains the RegPointNet model on the DrivAerNet++ dataset using point cloud representations.\n\n3. Finally, train the RegDGCNN model using:\n   ```\n   cd /workspace/DrivAerNet_v1/RegDGCNN\n   python train.py\n   ```\n   This script trains the RegDGCNN model on the original DrivAerNet dataset (4,000 car designs).\n\nEach script automatically evaluates the trained models on the test set and reports metrics including Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Maximum Absolute Error (Max AE), R2 score, training time, and inference time. The scripts use the train/val/test splits provided in the `/workspace/train_val_test_splits` directory.\n\nTo compare performance across different car design complexities, you may need to modify the dataset paths in the config dictionaries of each script to point to specific subsets of data with varying underbody details, wheel configurations, or rear design configurations.",
