  "agent_instructions": "Your task is to implement a system for training and evaluating three different deep learning models for aerodynamic drag prediction on car designs. The models should be trained on 3D car models and predict the drag coefficient (Cd) value.\n\n1. You need to implement three different model architectures:\n   - A Graph Neural Network (GNN) that processes car designs as graphs\n   - A PointNet model that processes car designs as point clouds\n   - A RegDGCNN (Dynamic Graph CNN for Regression) model that uses dynamic graph construction for point clouds\n\n2. For each model, you should:\n   - Load and preprocess the appropriate dataset (DrivAerNet++ for GNN and PointNet, original DrivAerNet for RegDGCNN)\n   - Split the data into training, validation, and test sets using predefined design IDs from text files\n   - Implement the training loop with appropriate loss function (MSE), optimizer, and learning rate scheduler\n   - Monitor validation performance and save the best model\n   - Evaluate the model on the test set and report metrics including MSE, MAE, Max AE, R² score, training time, and inference time\n\n3. The data processing should include:\n   - Loading 3D car models from STL files or preprocessed point clouds\n   - Loading corresponding drag coefficients from CSV files\n   - Normalizing the point cloud data\n   - Sampling or padding to ensure a fixed number of points per model\n   - Optional data augmentation techniques like translation, jittering, and point dropping\n\n4. The system should be configurable with hyperparameters for each model, including learning rate, batch size, number of epochs, etc.\n\nThe goal is to compare the performance of these different geometric deep learning approaches on the task of aerodynamic drag prediction.",
