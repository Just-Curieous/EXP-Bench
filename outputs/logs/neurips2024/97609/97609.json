            "question": "Do geometric deep learning models (PointNet, GCNN, and RegDGCNN) exhibit differential predictive accuracies for aerodynamic drag when applied to aerodynamic datasets with varying car design complexities, including differences in underbody details (detailed vs. smooth), wheel configurations (open vs. closed), and distinct rear design configurations? (Note: The evaluation involves datasets that incorporate diverse car configurations, as seen in DrivAerNet++ with detailed point cloud, mesh, and CFD simulation data.)",
            "method": "Train the three models using PyTorch and PyTorch Geometric on two datasets: DrivAerNet (4,000 car designs with splits of 2,800 for training, roughly 600 for validation, and 600 for testing) and DrivAerNet++ (8,000 car designs split into 5,600 for training, 1,200 for validation, and 1,200 for testing). Use both graph-based and point cloud representations during training. Evaluate the models using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Maximum Absolute Error (Max AE), R2 score, training time, inference time, and the number of parameters. Analyze how different design variations (e.g., underbody details, wheel configurations, rear design structures) impact predictive performance.",
            "expected_outcome": "It is anticipated that while all models will demonstrate competitive performance, distinct differences in accuracy will be observed. In the DrivAerNet dataset, RegDGCNN is expected to achieve the lowest MSE and highest R2 score. In contrast, the enhanced complexity and diversity of the DrivAerNet++ dataset are likely to challenge all models, leading to greater variation in error metrics and highlighting the sensitivity of geometric deep learning techniques to design complexity.",

            "question": "Does the predictive performance of surrogate models based on parametric data improve with increased training set size and differ across model architectures in aerodynamic drag prediction? This experiment uses aerodynamic car designs characterized by 26 parameters\u2014as provided in the DrivAerNet++ dataset, which includes diverse configurations such as fastback, notchback, and estateback\u2014for assessing performance scalability and model-specific behavior.",
            "method": "Utilize an AutoML framework optimized with Bayesian hyperparameter tuning to train models such as Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, LightGBM, and Random Forests on aerodynamic drag prediction using the 26 design parameters. The experiment involves performing two sets of trials: one with a single car design (fastback) and another with a combined dataset including fastback, notchback, and estateback configurations, as featured in the DrivAerNet++ dataset. In both scenarios, split the data into 80% for training and 20% for testing, and further subdivide the training set into portions of 20%, 40%, 60%, 80%, and 100%. The evaluation metric is the R2 score, to observe how performance scales with increasing training data and differs by model architecture.",
            "expected_outcome": "It is expected that all the surrogate models will perform better with an increase in training set size, with the AutoML framework revealing model-specific strengths. The paper indicates that AutoGluon performs well in the single-design scenario, whereas LightGBM excels on the combined dataset, thereby confirming the benefit of enlarging the training data and the influence of model architecture on prediction accuracy.",
