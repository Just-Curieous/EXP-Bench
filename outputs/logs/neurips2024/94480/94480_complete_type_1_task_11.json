      "question": "Can InfLLM maintain high retrieval accuracy across extremely long sequences (up to 1024K tokens), whereas sliding window-based baselines (e.g., InfiniteLM) suffer from performance collapse?",
      "method": "#### Experiment Components\n\n- **Base Model**:\n  - **Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2** for both InfLLM and LM-Infinite\n- **InfLLM Configuration**:\n  - **Local Window Size**: 4K\n  - **Memory Unit Size**: 128 tokens\n  - **# Representative Tokens**: 4\n  - **# Selected Memory Units**: 96\n  - **Encoding Chunk Size**: 512\n  - **Initial Tokens**: 128\n  - **CPU offloading** and **GPU cache** enabled\n- **Baseline**:\n  - **LM-Infinite**: uses **sliding local window** (e.g., 32K), no external memory\n  - Same chunking and input formatting as InfLLM, but no memory lookup\n- **Task**:\n  - **Retrieve.PassKey** from \u221e-Bench\n  - Each input contains a **5-digit key** embedded randomly in a **distractor context** of length L (32K\u20131024K)\n  - LLM must retrieve and reproduce the correct key from the sequence\n- **Input Sequence Lengths**:\n  - {32K, 64K, 128K, 256K, 512K, 768K, 1024K}\n- **Evaluation Setup**:\n  - For each sequence length:\n    - Generate **50 instances** with a single embedded key\n    - Maintain same key format and noise pattern\n  - **Accuracy (%)** is measured as exact match of the retrieved key\n- **Environment**:\n  - NVIDIA A100/A800 GPUs with fp16\n  - Max token limit bypassed via efficient chunked processing in InfLLM\n\n#### Reproduction Steps\n\n1. **Generate Synthetic Data**:\n   - Use scripts to generate sequences of lengths in the set {32K \u2026 1024K}\n   - Embed a 5-digit key at a random position in each sequence\n   - Fill the rest of the sequence with structured noise or distractor text\n2. **Configure Models**:\n   - For **LM-Infinite**: use 32K sliding window, no memory\n   - For **InfLLM**: enable context memory and follow default configs above\n3. **Run Inference**:\n   - Evaluate each of the 50 instances per length with both models\n   - Record whether the model retrieves the correct key\n   - Calculate **accuracy (%)** per length setting\n4. **Visualize Results**:\n   - Plot accuracy vs. input length (X-axis in thousands of tokens)",
