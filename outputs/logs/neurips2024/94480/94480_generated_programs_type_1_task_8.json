    "no_answer": "While the repository contains all the necessary components to conduct the experiment (InfLLM implementation with configurable topk parameter, evaluation scripts for âˆž-Bench benchmark), there is no single script or small set of scripts that directly answers the experiment question about varying the number of selected memory units. To conduct this experiment, one would need to create multiple configuration files with different topk values (2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 96, 128), run the evaluation script for each configuration, and then compare the results. This would require writing a custom script to automate this process, which is not present in the repository."
