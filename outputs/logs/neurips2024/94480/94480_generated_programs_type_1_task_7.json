    "no_answer": "After a comprehensive search of the repository, I could not find the specific scripts mentioned in the experiment question ('ablation_repr_tokens.sh' and 'plot_repr_tokens_results.py'). While the repository contains the InfLLM implementation with the 'repr_topk' parameter that controls the number of representative tokens per memory unit (found in /workspace/inf_llm/attention/inf_llm.py and /workspace/inf_llm/attention/context_manager.py), there are no scripts that specifically vary this parameter across the values {1, 2, 4, 8}, run experiments with these different values, and plot the results as described in the experiment question. The repository includes evaluation scripts in the /workspace/benchmark/ directory and execution scripts in the /workspace/scripts/ directory, but none that specifically address the experiment question about varying the number of representative tokens."
