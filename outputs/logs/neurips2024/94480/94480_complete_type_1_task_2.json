      "question": "Can InfLLM successfully extend the 4K context window of Vicuna to 128K tokens and improve its performance on long-context retrieval tasks such as Retrieve.PassKey and Retrieve.Number?",
      "method": "#### Experiment Components\n\n- **Base Model**:\n  - **Vicuna (Chiang et al., 2023)** \u2014 originally supports a maximum context of 4K tokens\n- **InfLLM Extension**:\n  - Context window extended to **128K tokens**\n  - Dynamic context memory applied to Vicuna via external memory architecture\n  - **Local window**: 4K\n  - **Memory unit size**: 128 tokens\n  - **# Representative tokens**: 4\n  - **# Selected memory units**: 96\n  - **Chunk size**: 512\n  - **Initial tokens**: 128\n- **Tasks & Dataset**:\n  - From \u221e-Bench, focused on:\n    - **Retrieve.PassKey (R.PK)**: locate 5-digit sequence\n    - **Retrieve.Number (R.Num)**: retrieve numerical content\n    - **Retrieve.KV (R.KV)**: retrieve structured key-value data\n    - **Math.Find (Math.F)**: mathematical reasoning over long context\n- **Evaluation Metric**:\n  - Accuracy (%) on each task\n- **Compute Setup**:\n  - Half-precision (fp16), single A100/A800 GPU\n  - FlashAttention and CPU/GPU memory offloading enabled\n\n#### Reproduction Steps\n\n1. **Set Up Vicuna**:\n   - Load Vicuna-7B base model (4K max context)\n   - Wrap with InfLLM adapter to expand input capacity to 128K\n2. **Prepare Evaluation Tasks**:\n   - Generate or reuse \u221e-Bench instances with 128K input length\n   - Ensure all input formats match previous InfLLM tasks\n3. **Inference**:\n   - Evaluate base **Vicuna** and **InfLLM-enhanced Vicuna**\n   - Use identical input instances for both variants\n4. **Compare Performance**:\n   - Measure retrieval and reasoning accuracy for all four tasks",
      "expected_outcome": "InfLLM enables Vicuna to scale to long input lengths (128K), resulting in drastic gains in retrieval tasks (R.PK and R.Num), while struggling to improve R.KV and Math.F due to Vicuna's weaker hidden representation capabilities in long-text settings.\n\n| Model             | R.PK  | R.Num | R.KV | Math.F |\n| ----------------- | ----- | ----- | ---- | ------ |\n| **Vicuna**        | 5.08  | 4.41  | 1.40 | 11.71  |\n| **InfLLM-Vicuna** | 99.15 | 81.69 | 0.60 | 11.14  |\n\n- InfLLM vastly enhances Vicuna's recall and retrieval ability for simpler long-sequence tasks (PassKey, Number).\n- However, due to Vicuna's limited expressiveness, context memory cannot fully compensate in more complex tasks like R.KV and Math.F.\n- Suggests that InfLLM\u2019s effectiveness depends not only on memory but also on the base model\u2019s representational strength.",
