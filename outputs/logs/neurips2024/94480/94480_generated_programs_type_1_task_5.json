    "no_answer": "While the repository contains scripts for evaluating InfLLM on ∞-Bench (infinitebench.sh), it does not contain a specific script or set of scripts that directly answers the experiment question about comparing InfLLM with Llama-1M (Llama-3-8B-Instruct-Gradient-1048k) in terms of performance, VRAM usage, and inference time. The repository provides the infrastructure to run InfLLM on ∞-Bench, but lacks scripts for measuring GPU memory usage, inference time, and doesn't include configurations for 'Llama-1M + InfLLM' as mentioned in the experiment. To answer this question, one would need to create additional scripts to run the evaluations on all three model configurations and measure the required metrics."
