    "no_answer": "After thoroughly examining the repository, I could not find any scripts or configurations specifically designed to evaluate InfLLM with Yi-9B-200K or Yi-200K models. The repository contains code for the InfLLM method and evaluation scripts for various models (like Mistral, Vicuna, Llama-3, etc.), but there are no explicit references to Yi-200K models in any of the configuration files, Python scripts, or shell scripts. The repository includes evaluation capabilities for InfiniteBench tasks mentioned in the question (R.PK, R.Num, R.KV, Choice QA, QA, Summarization, Math.Find), but no specific implementation or configuration for Yi-200K with the InfLLM parameters specified in the question. While the framework is flexible enough to potentially support such an experiment, there is no ready-made script that directly answers the specific experiment question about enhancing Yi-9B-200K with InfLLM."
