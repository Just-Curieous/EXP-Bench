    "no_answer": "After a thorough search of the repository, I couldn't find any specific scripts that directly evaluate and compare the LRU-based GPU cache management strategy with FIFO and Random alternatives as described in the experiment question. While the repository contains the implementation of the InfLLM system with the LRU-based cache management strategy in context_manager.py, there are no dedicated scripts that measure cache miss rates on the GovReport dataset or compare the performance of different cache strategies. The repository includes the core implementation of the cache management system but lacks the specific experimental evaluation scripts needed to answer the question about comparative performance of LRU vs. FIFO vs. Random strategies."
