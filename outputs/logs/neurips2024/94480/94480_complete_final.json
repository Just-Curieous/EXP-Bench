A memory management system that can store key-value pairs in memory units and efficiently move them between CPU and GPU\n2. A context manager that organizes tokens into blocks and manages which blocks are kept in memory\n3. A retrieval mechanism that finds the most relevant memory blocks for each query using similarity scores\n4. An attention mechanism that combines local attention (recent tokens) with global attention (retrieved memory blocks)\n5. Support for initial tokens as 'attention sinks' to maintain model stability\n6. A caching strategy to efficiently use GPU memory by keeping only the most relevant blocks loaded\n\nYour implementation should demonstrate how InfLLM can process sequences longer than the model's original context window while maintaining the ability to capture long-distance dependencies.",
