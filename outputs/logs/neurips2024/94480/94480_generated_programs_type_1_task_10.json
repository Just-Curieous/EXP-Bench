    "no_answer": "The repository does not contain specific scripts that directly implement the ablation studies mentioned in the experiment question (Decoding-Only, w/o Lookup, Mean Repr). While the repository contains the core InfLLM implementation with memory lookup and unit representation functionality in `/workspace/inf_llm/attention/context_manager.py`, there are no dedicated scripts or configuration files that specifically implement these ablation variants. To run these experiments, one would need to modify the existing code to disable memory lookup during encoding, disable it completely, or change the unit representation method to use mean vectors instead of representative tokens. The repository provides the base implementation but does not include ready-to-use scripts for these specific ablation studies."
