Then execute 'bash scripts/vicuna-baseline-experiment.sh' to evaluate the original Vicuna model (4K context) on the specified tasks. Finally, run 'bash scripts/vicuna-infllm-experiment.sh' to evaluate the InfLLM-enhanced Vicuna model (128K context) on the same tasks. Compare the results in the output JSON files to see the performance difference."
