      "question": "Can InfLLM, without requiring training or retrieval components, outperform RAG systems on context retrieval tasks, thereby demonstrating broader generalization and flexibility?",
      "method": "#### Experiment Components\n\n- **Models Compared**:\n  - **RAG-E5**:\n    - Retrieval-Augmented Generation system\n    - Uses **E5-Mistral-7B-Instruct** as retriever (Wang et al., 2024b)\n    - Performs dense vector search over the input context split into retrievable chunks\n    - Retrieved results are appended to the prompt for downstream reasoning\n  - **InfLLM**:\n    - Uses a local attention window and dynamic context memory without any training or additional components\n- **Tasks Evaluated**:\n  - **Retrieve.PassKey (R.PK)**: Find a specific 5-digit key from a long context\n  - **Retrieve.Num (R.Num)**: Retrieve numerical values associated with a query\n  - **Retrieve.KV (R.KV)**: Retrieve key-value pairs accurately from long documents\n- **Dataset**:\n  - \u221e-Bench subset focusing on context retrieval\n  - Input lengths extended to long sequences (e.g., 128K\u20131024K tokens)\n- **Retriever Details (RAG-E5)**:\n  - Contexts chunked into 512-token segments\n  - Retrieved top-K segments using E5-Mistral dense embeddings\n  - Reconstructed input fed into the base LLM for final answer generation\n- **InfLLM Configuration**:\n  - Same as Table 1 setup for Mistral-based InfLLM\n  - Local window: 4K\n  - Encoding chunk: 512\n  - Memory unit size: 128\n  - \\#Representative tokens per unit: 4\n  - Selected memory: 96 memory units\n- **Compute and Tooling**:\n  - Half-precision inference on A100/A800\n  - `InfLLM` via [official repo](https://github.com/thunlp/InfLLM)\n  - Retrieval system: Hugging Face `E5-Mistral-7B-Instruct` via `sentence-transformers` or custom FAISS-based search\n\n#### Reproduction Steps\n\n1. **Prepare Dataset**:\n   - Use \u221e-Bench retrieval tasks: R.PK, R.Num, and R.KV\n   - Create documents with embedded targets at various positions (lengths: 128K to 1024K)\n2. **RAG Pipeline**:\n   - Chunk documents into 512-token segments\n   - Use E5-Mistral to compute embeddings\n   - Perform dense retrieval using cosine similarity (e.g., FAISS)\n   - Append top-K chunks to prompt (e.g., K=4) and query base LLM\n3. **InfLLM Pipeline**:\n   - Use default context memory config (e.g., 96 units, 512 chunk, LRU update)\n   - No additional training or retrieval step\n4. **Evaluation**:\n   - Accuracy = % of correct answers across 100+ instances per task\n   - Identical test set and instance locations used across RAG and InfLLM",
