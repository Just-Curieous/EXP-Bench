    "no_answer": "After thoroughly exploring the repository, I couldn't find a single script or a small set of scripts that directly answers the experiment question about comparing InfLLM with sliding window baselines using a Llama-3 8B model on âˆž-Bench tasks. While the repository contains implementations for InfLLM, Infinite-LM, and Stream-LM attention mechanisms, and has configuration files for Llama-3, there's no dedicated script for running the comparison experiment. One would need to run the infinitebench.sh script multiple times with different configurations (changing the config parameter to point to different YAML files for each approach) and then manually compare the results. Additionally, there are no Llama-3 specific configurations for the baseline sliding window approaches (Infinite-LM and Stream-LM), so these would need to be created."
