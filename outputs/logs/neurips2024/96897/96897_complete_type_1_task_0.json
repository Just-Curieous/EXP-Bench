      "method": "Using the Alpaca-GPT4 dataset, finetune the Llama 3-8B model on a single RTX3090-24GB GPU. Configure the experiment to run for 3 epochs with a batch size of 2 as described in the subsection. Record the wall-clock time separately for the forward pass, backward pass (which includes re-forward passes due to gradient checkpointing), and update phases. Compare the averaged backward times as shown in Table 3 for BAdam, LOMO, and LoRA. This experiment should be repeated to capture variability and confirm the consistent observation that BAdam\u2019s backward pass is nearly half as long as that of LOMO and LoRA.\n  \n1. **Task Setup:**  \n   - **Goal:** Compare Trace and TextGrad for AI workflow optimization.  \n   - **Key Difference Between Methods:**  \n     - **Trace propagates minimal subgraphs** to separate tracing infrastructure from optimization algorithms.  \n     - **TextGrad propagates text feedback**, tightly coupling infrastructure and optimization.   \n\n2. **Experimental Design for Fair Comparison:**  \n   - Applied **Trace directly to the evaluation code released with the TextGrad library**.  \n   - Both frameworks used the **same LLM APIs at around the same time** to ensure fairness.  \n   - **Optimization Tasks Compared:**  \n     - **Solution Optimization** (TextGrad Table 2).  \n     - **Prompt Optimization** (TextGrad Table 3).  \n\n3. **Comparative Evaluation:**  \n   - **OptoPrime (Trace\u2019s optimizer)**  \n   - **TextGrad (original implementation)**",
      "expected_outcome": "Based on the reported results, BAdam is expected to show a significantly reduced backward pass time (approximately 1.74 hours per epoch) compared to LOMO (3.70 hours) and LoRA (3.20 hours), confirming the efficiency improvements discussed in Section 2.2.2.\n  \n- **OptoPrime should be approximately 3x faster than TextGrad**, since:  \n  - OptoPrime makes **one LLM call per optimization step**.  \n  - TextGrad makes **a number of LLM calls proportional to the graph\u2019s size**.",
