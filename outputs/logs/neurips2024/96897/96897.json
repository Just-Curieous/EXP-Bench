Select a representative LLM (e.g., Llama 2-7B or Llama 3-8B) and fine-tune it under identical conditions for each ordering variant. For each configuration, run multiple trials (at least three runs) to collect convergence data (loss values over epochs) and record the convergence speed as well as final performance. Use statistical analysis (e.g., error bars, confidence intervals) to compare the convergence curves and evaluate if differences are statistically significant.\n  \n1. **Task Setup:**  \n   - **Goal:** Compare Trace and TextGrad for AI workflow optimization.  \n   - **Key Difference Between Methods:**  \n     - **Trace propagates minimal subgraphs** to separate tracing infrastructure from optimization algorithms.  \n     - **TextGrad propagates text feedback**, tightly coupling infrastructure and optimization.   \n\n2. **Experimental Design for Fair Comparison:**  \n   - Applied **Trace directly to the evaluation code released with the TextGrad library**.  \n   - Both frameworks used the **same LLM APIs at around the same time** to ensure fairness.  \n   - **Optimization Tasks Compared:**  \n     - **Solution Optimization** (TextGrad Table 2).  \n     - **Prompt Optimization** (TextGrad Table 3).  \n\n3. **Comparative Evaluation:**  \n   - **OptoPrime (Trace\u2019s optimizer)**  \n   - **TextGrad (original implementation)**",
