    "no_answer": "After thoroughly examining the repository, I couldn't find a specific script or set of scripts that directly answer the experiment question about backward computation schemes affecting backward pass time. While the repository contains implementations of the BAdam optimizer (in src/badam/block_optim.py and llama-alpaca/src/llmtuner/tuner/sft/block_optim.py) that can selectively update different parts of the model, and there are time measurement functions in the trainer.py file that record backward pass time, there is no dedicated script that implements the three specific backward schemes mentioned in the experiment question: (a) compute gradients for all modules, (b) compute gradients only for the input module, and (c) compute gradients only for the output module. The repository focuses on the BAdam optimizer implementation but doesn't include the specific controlled experiment setup described in the question."
