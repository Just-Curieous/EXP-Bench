      "method": "Perform an ablation study using the finetuning setup on the Alpaca-GPT4 dataset for the Llama 3-8B model. Implement both BCD variants (BAdam and BSGD) and their full-update counterparts (Adam and SGD). Record the training loss curves over data passes (iterations) and training time. After training, compute the MT-bench scores for each method. Ensure that each method uses identical training data batches and that only the parameter update strategy is varied. Analyze whether updating only one block per data batch improves the retention of the pretrained model\u2019s general knowledge by comparing downstream performance metrics.\n  \n1. **Task Setup:**  \n   - **Goal:** Compare Trace and TextGrad for AI workflow optimization.  \n   - **Key Difference Between Methods:**  \n     - **Trace propagates minimal subgraphs** to separate tracing infrastructure from optimization algorithms.  \n     - **TextGrad propagates text feedback**, tightly coupling infrastructure and optimization.   \n\n2. **Experimental Design for Fair Comparison:**  \n   - Applied **Trace directly to the evaluation code released with the TextGrad library**.  \n   - Both frameworks used the **same LLM APIs at around the same time** to ensure fairness.  \n   - **Optimization Tasks Compared:**  \n     - **Solution Optimization** (TextGrad Table 2).  \n     - **Prompt Optimization** (TextGrad Table 3).  \n\n3. **Comparative Evaluation:**  \n   - **OptoPrime (Trace\u2019s optimizer)**  \n   - **TextGrad (original implementation)**",
      "expected_outcome": "It is expected that BCD variants (especially BSGD and BAdam) will show similar convergence behavior in terms of training loss but will achieve higher MT-bench scores than their full counterparts, with BSGD significantly outperforming SGD. This suggests that the block-wise updates better preserve general knowledge during finetuning.\n  \n- **OptoPrime should be approximately 3x faster than TextGrad**, since:  \n  - OptoPrime makes **one LLM call per optimization step**.  \n  - TextGrad makes **a number of LLM calls proportional to the graph\u2019s size**.",
