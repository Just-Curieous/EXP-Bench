            "method": "Using the Alpaca-GPT4 dataset, finetune the Llama 3-8B model on a single RTX3090-24GB GPU. Configure the experiment to run for 3 epochs with a batch size of 2 as described in the subsection. Record the wall-clock time separately for the forward pass, backward pass (which includes re-forward passes due to gradient checkpointing), and update phases. Compare the averaged backward times as shown in Table 3 for BAdam, LOMO, and LoRA. This experiment should be repeated to capture variability and confirm the consistent observation that BAdam\u2019s backward pass is nearly half as long as that of LOMO and LoRA.\n  \n1. **Task Setup:**  \n   - **Goal:** Compare Trace and TextGrad for AI workflow optimization.  \n   - **Key Difference Between Methods:**  \n     - **Trace propagates minimal subgraphs** to separate tracing infrastructure from optimization algorithms.  \n     - **TextGrad propagates text feedback**, tightly coupling infrastructure and optimization.   \n\n2. **Experimental Design for Fair Comparison:**  \n   - Applied **Trace directly to the evaluation code released with the TextGrad library**.  \n   - Both frameworks used the **same LLM APIs at around the same time** to ensure fairness.  \n   - **Optimization Tasks Compared:**  \n     - **Solution Optimization** (TextGrad Table 2).  \n     - **Prompt Optimization** (TextGrad Table 3).  \n\n3. **Comparative Evaluation:**  \n   - **OptoPrime (Trace\u2019s optimizer)**  \n   - **TextGrad (original implementation)**",

Accepts command-line arguments for model configuration, dataset selection, and training hyperparameters\n2. Supports fine-tuning Llama models (both Llama 2 and Llama 3) on instruction datasets\n3. Implements the block-wise optimization strategy with the following features:\n   - Divides the model parameters into blocks (typically by layers)\n   - Updates only one block of parameters at each optimization step\n   - Rotates through different blocks using configurable strategies (random, ascending, or descending order)\n   - Allows setting how frequently to switch between blocks\n4. Supports comparison with other fine-tuning methods like full parameter fine-tuning, LoRA, and sparse fine-tuning\n\nThe script should be able to run commands like:\n```bash\npython train_script.py \\\n    --stage sft \\\n    --model_name_or_path meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-hf \\\n    --do_train \\\n    --dataset alpaca_gpt4_en \\\n    --template default \\\n    --finetuning_type block \\\n    --output_dir ./outputs/llama2-7b-badam-1e-5 \\\n    --overwrite_cache \\\n    --per_device_train_batch_size 2 \\\n    --gradient_accumulation_steps 8 \\\n    --learning_rate 1e-5 \\\n    --num_train_epochs 3 \\\n    --switch_block_every 100 \\\n    --switch_mode random \\\n    --bf16 True\n```\n\nThe implementation should be efficient and handle gradient checkpointing appropriately to manage memory usage during training.",
