    "no_answer": "After thoroughly exploring the repository, I couldn't find scripts that directly answer the experiment question about comparing BAdam and LoRA when finetuning Llama 3-70B on MathInstruct dataset. While the repository contains the BAdam implementation and supports both BAdam and LoRA finetuning methods, as well as DeepSpeed ZeRO-3 for model parallel training (necessary for 70B models), there are no specific scripts for: 1) Using the MathInstruct dataset, 2) Evaluating on the required math benchmarks (GSM8K, Aqua, MMLU-Math, SAT-Math, MATH, and NumGLUE), or 3) Running the specific experimental protocol described in the question. The repository has the infrastructure to potentially run such experiments, but would require significant modifications and additional code to implement the specific experiment described."
