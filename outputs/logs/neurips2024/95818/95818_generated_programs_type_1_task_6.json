    "no_answer": "After thoroughly exploring the repository, I couldn't find any scripts that directly compare different classification loss functions (Softmax Loss, Binary Cross-Entropy Loss, Asymmetric Loss, Soft Margin Loss, Two-Way Loss) for SuperClass models on ImageNet-1K. The repository contains the SuperClass implementation with a default loss function (which appears to be a softmax-based loss), but there are no scripts or configuration options to switch between different loss functions or run comparative experiments. The training scripts (train.sh and train_combo.sh) and configuration files in /workspace/opencls/configs/cls_schedule/ don't have parameters to specify different loss functions. The results mentioned in the experiment question might be from experiments conducted outside this codebase or require significant code modifications to implement."
