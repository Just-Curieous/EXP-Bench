Then, train the models with subword-level tokenizer by modifying the model configurations to use HFTokenizer. Create copies of the config files and add `\"hf_tokenizer_name\": \"bert-base-uncased\"` to the `text_cfg` section in each config file. Then run:\n   ```\n   bash train.sh opencls/configs/cls_schedule/cls_vit_s16_subword_s512m_bs16k.yaml opencls\n   bash train.sh opencls/configs/cls_schedule/cls_vit_b16_subword_s512m_bs16k.yaml opencls\n   bash train.sh opencls/configs/cls_schedule/cls_vit_l16_subword_s512m_bs16k.yaml opencls\n   ```\n\n3.

Additionally, the subword dictionary contains many words unrelated to visual content that frequently appear in sentences but do not provide effective supervisory information. Therefore, words with higher information content should be given greater weight during training.\n\n- To achieve this, we employ **Inverse Document Frequency (IDF)** as a measure of information significance. The fewer the number of samples containing a specific word, the stronger its ability to differentiate between samples. We use the IDF statistic of each category (subword) as the weight for the corresponding classification label, assigning different weights \\( w_c \\) to the classification labels \\( c \\):\n\n```\n\\[\n\\hat{y_c} = \\frac{w_c y_c}{\\sum_{c'} w_{c'} y_{c'}}\n\\]\n\nwhere the weight \\( w_c \\) is computed as follows:\n\n\\[\nw_c = \\log \\frac{|D|}{1 + \\text{df}(c)}\n\\]\n\nwhere:\n\n- \\(|D|\\) denotes the total number of image-text pairs.\n- \\(\\text{df}(c)\\) is the document frequency (df) of subword \\( c \\), meaning the count of texts containing subword \\( c \\).\n```",

      "no_answer": "After a thorough examination of the repository, I couldn't find any scripts or configuration options that specifically address the experiment question about the impact of removing stopwords on classification accuracy in SuperClass models. The repository contains code for training and evaluating SuperClass models, but there's no explicit functionality for stopword removal or comparison between models with and without stopwords. The tokenizer.py file contains text processing functionality, but there's no specific stopword removal feature or configuration option. The repository doesn't appear to have been set up to directly answer this specific experimental question."
