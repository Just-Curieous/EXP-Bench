    "no_answer": "After a thorough examination of the repository, I couldn't find any scripts or configuration options that specifically address the experiment question about the impact of removing stopwords on classification accuracy in SuperClass models. The repository contains code for training and evaluating SuperClass models, but there's no explicit functionality for stopword removal or comparison between models with and without stopwords. The tokenizer.py file contains text processing functionality, but there's no specific stopword removal feature or configuration option. The repository doesn't appear to have been set up to directly answer this specific experimental question."
