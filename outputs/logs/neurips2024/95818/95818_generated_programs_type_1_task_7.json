    "usage_instructions": "To compare SuperClass models with and without IDF class weighting, you need to modify the `reweight_targets` method in the `ClsLoss` class in `/workspace/opencls/open_clip/loss.py`. \n\n1. First, train a SuperClass model with IDF weighting (default behavior) using:\n   ```bash\n   bash train.sh configs/cls_schedule/cls_vit_l16_s512m_bs16k.yaml opencls\n   ```\n\n2. Then, modify the `reweight_targets` method in `/workspace/opencls/open_clip/loss.py` to disable IDF weighting by changing it to simply return the original targets without applying the IDF formula:\n   ```python\n   def reweight_targets(self, cap_fq, num_samples, targets):\n       # Comment out the IDF weighting code\n       # cap_fq += targets.sum(dim=0, keepdim=True) / targets.shape[0]\n       # num_samples += 1\n       # dist.all_reduce(cap_fq, op=dist.ReduceOp.AVG)\n       # dist.all_reduce(num_samples, op=dist.ReduceOp.AVG)\n       # all_batch_size = self.world_size * targets.shape[0]\n       # targets = targets * torch.log((num_samples+1.0/all_batch_size) / (cap_fq+1.0/all_batch_size)).to(dtype=targets.dtype)\n       \n       # Simply return the original targets without IDF weighting\n       return targets\n   ```\n\n3. Train another SuperClass model with the modified code (no IDF weighting):\n   ```bash\n   bash train.sh configs/cls_schedule/cls_vit_l16_s512m_bs16k.yaml opencls\n   ```\n\n4. Compare the zero-shot and linear probing accuracy on ImageNet-1K between the two models to determine whether IDF weighting improves classification accuracy."
