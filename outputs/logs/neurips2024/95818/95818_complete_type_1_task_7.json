      "question": "Does using IDF as class weights improve classification accuracy in SuperClass models?",
      "method": "1. **Problem Setup:** \n    - **Task:** \n    Evaluate the impact of using Inverse Document Frequency (IDF) as class weights on classification accuracy in SuperClass models.\n    - **Pretraining data:**\n    Datacomp-1B dataset\n    - **Model Variant:**\n        - SuperClass with ViT-L/16 backbone.\n        - All models trained with the same batch size (16K).\n    - **Objective:** \n    Determine whether incorporating IDF-based class weighting improves classification accuracy compared to training without IDF weighting.\n\n2. **Benchmark Dataset:** \n    Classification: ImageNet-1K (Zero-shot & Linear Probing).\n\n3. **Comparative Evaluation:**  \n    - With IDF as class weights\n    - Without IDF as class weights.\n\n4. **Evaluation Metrics:**\n    - Zero-shot classification accuracy on ImageNet-1K.\n\n    - Linear probing accuracy on ImageNet-1K.\n\n5. **IDF:**\n# Inverse Document Frequency\n\n- Within the subword vocabulary, not all categories contribute equally semantically, as different words carry varying amounts of information. Additionally, the subword dictionary contains many words unrelated to visual content that frequently appear in sentences but do not provide effective supervisory information. Therefore, words with higher information content should be given greater weight during training.\n\n- To achieve this, we employ **Inverse Document Frequency (IDF)** as a measure of information significance. The fewer the number of samples containing a specific word, the stronger its ability to differentiate between samples. We use the IDF statistic of each category (subword) as the weight for the corresponding classification label, assigning different weights \\( w_c \\) to the classification labels \\( c \\):\n\n```\n\\[\n\\hat{y_c} = \\frac{w_c y_c}{\\sum_{c'} w_{c'} y_{c'}}\n\\]\n\nwhere the weight \\( w_c \\) is computed as follows:\n\n\\[\nw_c = \\log \\frac{|D|}{1 + \\text{df}(c)}\n\\]\n\nwhere:\n\n- \\(|D|\\) denotes the total number of image-text pairs.\n- \\(\\text{df}(c)\\) is the document frequency (df) of subword \\( c \\), meaning the count of texts containing subword \\( c \\).\n```",
