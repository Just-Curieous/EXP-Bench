    "no_answer": "After a thorough examination of the repository, I couldn't find any specific scripts or configuration files that directly compare the performance of different subword-level tokenizers (BPE, WordPiece, and SentencePiece) in SuperClass models. While the codebase supports using different tokenizers through HuggingFace integration, there are no ready-made scripts to run this specific experiment. The repository contains model configurations with various tokenizers (like bert-base-uncased which uses WordPiece, roberta-base which uses BPE, etc.), but no direct comparison experiment for tokenizers in SuperClass models with ViT-L/16 backbone. To run this experiment, one would need to create custom model configurations for CLS-ViT-L-16 with different tokenizers and train them separately."
