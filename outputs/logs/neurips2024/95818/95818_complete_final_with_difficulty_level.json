Additionally, the subword dictionary contains many words unrelated to visual content that frequently appear in sentences but do not provide effective supervisory information. Therefore, words with higher information content should be given greater weight during training.\n\n- To achieve this, we employ **Inverse Document Frequency (IDF)** as a measure of information significance. The fewer the number of samples containing a specific word, the stronger its ability to differentiate between samples. We use the IDF statistic of each category (subword) as the weight for the corresponding classification label, assigning different weights \\( w_c \\) to the classification labels \\( c \\):\n\n```\n\\[\n\\hat{y_c} = \\frac{w_c y_c}{\\sum_{c'} w_{c'} y_{c'}}\n\\]\n\nwhere the weight \\( w_c \\) is computed as follows:\n\n\\[\nw_c = \\log \\frac{|D|}{1 + \\text{df}(c)}\n\\]\n\nwhere:\n\n- \\(|D|\\) denotes the total number of image-text pairs.\n- \\(\\text{df}(c)\\) is the document frequency (df) of subword \\( c \\), meaning the count of texts containing subword \\( c \\).\n```",
