The repository already has configuration files for different sample sizes (512M and 1.28B), but you'll need to create a configuration file for 128M samples by modifying the existing cls_vit_l16_s512m_bs16k.yaml file.\n\n1. Create a new configuration file for 128M samples:\n   - Copy /workspace/opencls/configs/cls_schedule/cls_vit_l16_s512m_bs16k.yaml to /workspace/opencls/configs/cls_schedule/cls_vit_l16_s128m_bs16k.yaml\n   - Modify the 'train_num_samples' parameter from 512_000_000 to 128_000_000\n   - Modify the 'train_data' path to include fewer tar files (approximately 1/4 of the original range)\n\n2. Run the training script for each configuration:\n   ```bash\n   # Train with 128M samples\n   bash train.sh configs/cls_schedule/cls_vit_l16_s128m_bs16k.yaml opencls\n   \n   # Train with 512M samples\n   bash train.sh configs/cls_schedule/cls_vit_l16_s512m_bs16k.yaml opencls\n   \n   # Train with 1.28B samples\n   bash train.sh configs/cls_schedule/cls_vit_l14_s1.28B_bs16k.yaml opencls\n   ```\n\n3. The evaluation is automatically performed during training. The script will report both zero-shot classification accuracy and linear probing accuracy on ImageNet-1K for each model.\n\nNote: Make sure to update the DATA_PATH and VAL_DATA_PATH in train.sh to point to your local paths for Datacomp-1B and ImageNet-1K datasets before running the commands.",
