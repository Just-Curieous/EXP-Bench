    "no_answer": "After thoroughly exploring the repository, I couldn't find a specific script or set of scripts that directly compare SuperClass with BEiT in terms of Top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K. The repository contains code for training and evaluating SuperClass on ImageNet-1K (through the train.sh script and zero_shot_eval function), but it doesn't include any implementation of BEiT or a direct comparison between the two models. The repository is focused on implementing and evaluating SuperClass, not on comparing it with other models like BEiT. The comparison mentioned in the experiment question appears to be part of the paper's results, but it's not directly implemented as a script in this repository."
