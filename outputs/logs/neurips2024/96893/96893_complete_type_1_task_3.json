      "question": "Does scaling up the training dataset size improve the segmentation performance in terms of Dice score on the BTCV dataset using the SegVol framework?",
      "method": "Conduct an ablation study on the BTCV dataset (which comprises 13 major organs) by training separate models with increasing amounts of training data: one dataset, two datasets, eight datasets, and the full set of 25 datasets. Use the SegVol training code with its standard configuration and train each model for 500 epochs. Evaluate each model on the 20% test split with particular attention to the text prompt setting to assess the effect of additional training data on the Dice score.",
      "expected_outcome": "The experiment is expected to show that the Dice score increases rapidly with more training data, particularly in the text prompt setting, thereby demonstrating the scalability and benefit of using more extensive training data.",

      "usage_instructions": "To conduct the ablation study on scaling up training dataset size with the BTCV dataset, follow these steps:\n\n1. First, modify the dataset_codes parameter in train.py to include different numbers of datasets:\n   - For one dataset: Change line 21 to `parser.add_argument(\"--dataset_codes\", type = list, default=['0004'])` (assuming BTCV has code 0004)\n   - For two datasets: Use default `parser.add_argument(\"--dataset_codes\", type = list, default=['0004', '0005'])`\n   - For eight datasets: Change to `parser.add_argument(\"--dataset_codes\", type = list, default=['0004', '0005', '0006', '0007', '0008', '0009', '0010', '0011'])`\n   - For all 25 datasets: Include all dataset codes from 0001 to 0025\n\n2. For each configuration, run the training script with 500 epochs (default setting in line 44):\n   ```\n   export SEGVOL_CKPT=\"path/to/SegVol_v1.pth\"\n   export WORK_DIR=\"./work_dir_[dataset_size]\"\n   export DATA_DIR=\"path/to/dataset_post\"\n   CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7 python train.py --resume $SEGVOL_CKPT -work_dir $WORK_DIR --data_dir $DATA_DIR\n   ```\n\n3. After training each model, evaluate it on the BTCV test split using inference_demo.py:\n   ```\n   export segvol_ckpt=\"./work_dir_[dataset_size]/[checkpoint_file].pth\"\n   export work_dir=\"./results_[dataset_size]\"\n   export demo_config_path=\"./config/config_btcv.json\"\n   CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python inference_demo.py --resume $segvol_ckpt -work_dir $work_dir --demo_config $demo_config_path\n   ```\n   Note: You'll need to create a config_btcv.json file similar to config_demo.json but with BTCV dataset paths and organ categories.\n\n4. Make sure to set args.use_text_prompt = True in inference_demo.py (line 209) to assess the text prompt setting as specified in the experiment.\n\n5. Compare the Dice scores reported in the output of each inference run to observe how performance scales with increasing training data size.",
