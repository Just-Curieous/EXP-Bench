For semantic (text) prompt only:\n   - Set args.use_text_prompt = True\n   - Set args.use_box_prompt = False\n   - Set args.use_point_prompt = False\n\n2. For spatial (bounding box) prompt only:\n   - Set args.use_text_prompt = False\n   - Set args.use_box_prompt = True\n   - Set args.use_point_prompt = False\n\n3. For combined semantic and spatial prompts:\n   - Set args.use_text_prompt = True\n   - Set args.use_box_prompt = True\n   - Set args.use_point_prompt = False\n\nFor each configuration, update the config_demo.json file to include the 19 anatomical segmentation tasks, then run 'bash script/inference_demo.sh'. The script will output Dice scores for each configuration, which can be compared to assess the benefits of combining prompt modalities."
