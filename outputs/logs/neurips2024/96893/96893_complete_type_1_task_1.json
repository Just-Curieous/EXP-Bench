      "question": "Does combining semantic (text) prompts with spatial (bounding box) prompts improve segmentation accuracy compared to using either prompt individually on multiple anatomical segmentation tasks? In the context of the SegVol framework\u2014which is designed to accept text, box, and point prompts for volumetric medical image segmentation\u2014this investigation aims to determine whether integrating both modalities can better resolve ambiguities and boost performance across a diverse set of anatomical structures.",
      "method": "Conduct experiments using the SegVol model on 19 anatomical segmentation tasks. Use three prompt configurations: (1) semantic prompt (text) only, (2) spatial prompt (bounding box) only, and (3) a combination of semantic and spatial prompts. Ensure that all experiments use the same test data split along with identical pre-processing and model conditions. Record the Dice scores for each configuration across the anatomical structures, and compare the performance improvements to assess the benefits of combining the prompt modalities.",
      "expected_outcome": "The experiments are expected to show that the combined use of semantic and spatial prompts significantly improves segmentation accuracy, achieving a higher Dice score (approximately 83.02%) compared to using either prompt individually, which supports the claim that semantic prompts clarify ambiguities inherent in spatial prompts.",

      "agent_instructions": "Your task is to implement a medical image segmentation system that compares the performance of different prompt types for 3D CT scan segmentation. The system should:\n\n1. Load a pre-trained volumetric segmentation model based on the Segment Anything Model (SAM) architecture\n2. Process 3D CT scans and their corresponding ground truth segmentation masks\n3. Implement three different prompting strategies:\n   - Semantic prompting: Using text descriptions of anatomical structures\n   - Spatial prompting: Using bounding boxes around regions of interest\n   - Combined prompting: Using both text and bounding box information together\n\n4. For each prompting strategy, the system should:\n   - Generate appropriate prompts based on the ground truth data\n   - Perform a two-stage inference process:\n     a) Zoom-out: Initial whole-volume inference\n     b) Zoom-in: Refined inference on detected regions of interest\n   - Calculate Dice similarity scores between predictions and ground truth\n   - Visualize results with overlays showing the original image, ground truth, and predictions\n\n5. The system should be configurable through a JSON file that specifies:\n   - Dataset name\n   - List of anatomical categories to segment (e.g., liver, kidney, spleen, pancreas)\n   - Paths to CT scans and ground truth segmentations\n\n6. The implementation should support command-line arguments for:\n   - Model checkpoint path\n   - Output directory for results\n   - Configuration file path\n\nThe goal is to demonstrate how combining different prompt types (semantic and spatial) improves segmentation accuracy compared to using either prompt type alone.",
