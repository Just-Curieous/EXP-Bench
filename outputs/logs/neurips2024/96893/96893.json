            "question": "Does the zoom-out-zoom-in mechanism outperform traditional simple resize and sliding window methods in terms of both Dice score and inference time for volumetric CT segmentation?",
            "method": "Conduct a controlled experiment on a volumetric CT dataset by implementing three segmentation configurations: (1) a simple resize method targeting a Dice score of approximately 0.4509 with an inference time of 65 ms per case; (2) a sliding window approach targeting a Dice score of about 0.6529 with an inference time of 3331 ms per case; and (3) the zoom-out-zoom-in mechanism targeting a Dice score of around 0.7298 with an inference time of 190 ms per case. Use the same dataset, identical pre-processing, and infer on equivalent cases using the same hardware configuration (e.g., 8 NVIDIA A100-SXM4-40GB). Measure and compare the median Dice scores and per-case inference times across the methods.",
            "expected_outcome": "The zoom-out-zoom-in mechanism should yield the highest median Dice score (around 0.73) while maintaining much lower inference time compared to the sliding window approach, thereby confirming its superior balance of segmentation accuracy and computational efficiency compared to the simple resize and sliding window methods.",

In the context of the SegVol framework\u2014which is designed to accept text, box, and point prompts for volumetric medical image segmentation\u2014this investigation aims to determine whether integrating both modalities can better resolve ambiguities and boost performance across a diverse set of anatomical structures.",
            "method": "Conduct experiments using the SegVol model on 19 anatomical segmentation tasks. Use three prompt configurations: (1) semantic prompt (text) only, (2) spatial prompt (bounding box) only, and (3) a combination of semantic and spatial prompts. Ensure that all experiments use the same test data split along with identical pre-processing and model conditions. Record the Dice scores for each configuration across the anatomical structures, and compare the performance improvements to assess the benefits of combining the prompt modalities.",
            "expected_outcome": "The experiments are expected to show that the combined use of semantic and spatial prompts significantly improves segmentation accuracy, achieving a higher Dice score (approximately 83.02%) compared to using either prompt individually, which supports the claim that semantic prompts clarify ambiguities inherent in spatial prompts.",

            "method": "Using the AMOS22 dataset with 48 cases covering 15 major organs, perform segmentation experiments comparing three approaches: (a) a simple resize strategy, (b) a sliding window approach that scans the entire 3D CT with thousands of windows, and (c) a zoom-out-zoom-in mechanism that conducts one global inference on the full 3D CT followed by targeted local scanning using dozens of windows. Performance is assessed by computing the Dice score and recording the inference time per case on the same 20% test split.",
            "expected_outcome": "The zoom-out-zoom-in mechanism is expected to achieve the best average Dice score while maintaining a competitive inference speed compared to the simple resize approach. Additionally, it should be far more efficient than the sliding window method in terms of computational cost, as it reduces the number of windows scanned.",

Use the SegVol training code with its standard configuration and train each model for 500 epochs. Evaluate each model on the 20% test split with particular attention to the text prompt setting to assess the effect of additional training data on the Dice score.",

Quantitatively analyze the average Dice scores, noting that the bbox+text combination is expected to show a notable improvement over text-only, and point+text is expected to outperform using points alone.",
            "expected_outcome": "It is expected that combining spatial and semantic prompts will yield higher Dice scores than when using either prompt individually, by reducing ambiguities in the spatial information and providing clearer anatomical references for segmentation.",

            "question": "Does the inclusion of semantic prompts effectively disambiguate the segmentation output when a single spatial prompt could correspond to multiple plausible anatomical structures, particularly given that SegVol is designed to accept point, box, and text prompts for volumetric segmentation?",
            "method": "Collect a set of medical images where a single point or bounding box spatial prompt ambiguously corresponds to multiple targets (for instance, a prompt that might refer to a kidney tumor, left kidney, or the entire kidneys; or liver, liver tumor, or hepatic vessels). For each image, add an additional text prompt that explicitly specifies the intended anatomical structure (for example, 'kidney tumor' or 'liver'). Run the SegVol segmentation algorithm, which integrates multi-modal prompts including text, and then assess the output masks by comparing them to the intended targets. Verify that only one clear and accurate mask is generated per image, rather than multiple plausible outputs.",
            "expected_outcome": "The experiment should demonstrate that when a clear semantic prompt is provided in addition to the ambiguous spatial prompt, SegV ol produces a single, unambiguous segmentation mask that accurately corresponds to the specified anatomical target, thereby resolving the ambiguity inherent in the spatial prompt alone.",

            "method": "Select medical images from CT scans that showcase clearly defined regions, such as cases of liver and liver tumors. For each image, place a spatial prompt (for example a point or bounding box) over the region of interest. Run SegVol, which leverages its interactive segmentation capability and decodes the semantic information using a pre-defined set of anatomical labels along with a softmax function to produce prediction probabilities. Record the prediction probability for the liver category in the liver case, and for the liver tumor case record the probabilities for both the tumor and liver categories. Finally, compare the outputs to validate the model\u2019s ability to differentiate between the specified anatomical categories.",
            "expected_outcome": "The results should indicate that SegV ol assigns a high probability to the correct organ category when a spatial prompt targets a specific structure, confirming that for a liver prompt, a liver probability near 0.997 is achieved, and for a liver tumor prompt, the probability favors the tumor category (approximately 0.619 over 0.339 for liver). This would validate the model's ability to accurately identify semantic categories from spatial-prompt segmentation results.",

        "The paper demonstrates that the proposed zoom-out-zoom-in mechanism for 3D medical image segmentation achieves higher accuracy (Dice score) than traditional methods. Specifically, it obtains a Dice score of 0.7298 compared to 0.6529 with the sliding window approach and 0.4509 with simple resize.",
        "The zoom-out-zoom-in approach is computationally efficient. It requires one global inference on the full 3D CT and then refines the region of interest using a limited number of windows (dozens instead of thousands), resulting in significantly lower inference times (190 ms per case) than the sliding window method (3331 ms per case).",
        "Increasing the amount of training data improves segmentation performance, with experiments showing higher Dice scores as the training dataset scales up.",
        "Combining semantic prompts (text) with spatial prompts (bounding box, point) enhances segmentation performance. For example, using a combination such as 'Bbox+text' achieves a higher Dice score (83.02%) compared to using either prompt type alone (e.g., text-only scored 77.17% and point-only scored 73.67%).",
        "The integration of semantic prompt information helps resolve ambiguities inherent in spatial prompts, reducing the risk of multi-plausible outputs in segmentation tasks."
