Use the same dataset, identical pre-processing, and infer on equivalent cases using the same hardware configuration (e.g., 8 NVIDIA A100-SXM4-40GB). Measure and compare the median Dice scores and per-case inference times across the methods.",

For each prompting strategy, the system should:\n   - Generate appropriate prompts based on the ground truth data\n   - Perform a two-stage inference process:\n     a) Zoom-out: Initial whole-volume inference\n     b) Zoom-in: Refined inference on detected regions of interest\n   - Calculate Dice similarity scores between predictions and ground truth\n   - Visualize results with overlays showing the original image, ground truth, and predictions\n\n5. The system should be configurable through a JSON file that specifies:\n   - Dataset name\n   - List of anatomical categories to segment (e.g., liver, kidney, spleen, pancreas)\n   - Paths to CT scans and ground truth segmentations\n\n6. The implementation should support command-line arguments for:\n   - Model checkpoint path\n   - Output directory for results\n   - Configuration file path\n\nThe goal is to demonstrate how combining different prompt types (semantic and spatial) improves segmentation accuracy compared to using either prompt type alone.",

These tasks primarily involve using and evaluating existing methods and do not contribute directly to the novel algorithm or model architecture. Steps 3 and 9 involve initializing the SegVol model and implementing the zoom-in-zoom-out inference strategy, which align with the novel contributions of the paper and thus are classified as core components.
