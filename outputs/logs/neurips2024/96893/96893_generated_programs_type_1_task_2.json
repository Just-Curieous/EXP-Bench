    "usage_instructions": "1. First, modify the config_demo.json file to point to the AMOS22 dataset with paths to CT scans and ground truth segmentations for the 15 major organs. Update the 'categories' field to include all 15 organ names.\n2. Update the inference_demo.sh script with the path to the SegVol checkpoint and desired output directory.\n3. To compare the three approaches, run the script three times with different configurations:\n   a) For the simple resize strategy: Set args.use_zoom_in = False in line 208 of inference_demo.py\n   b) For the sliding window approach: Comment out lines 73-105 in inference_demo.py (the zoom-out part) and modify the sliding_window_inference call to scan the entire image\n   c) For the zoom-out-zoom-in mechanism: Keep the default setting with args.use_zoom_in = True\n4. Execute each configuration using 'bash script/inference_demo.sh' and compare the Dice scores and inference times printed in the output."
