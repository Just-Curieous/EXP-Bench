    "usage_instructions": "1. First, modify the config_demo.json file to include ambiguous cases where a single point or box could correspond to multiple anatomical structures (e.g., kidney tumor vs. kidney vs. kidneys, or liver vs. liver tumor vs. hepatic vessels). Set the 'categories' field to include these structures and provide paths to the CT and ground truth files.\n2. In inference_demo.py, ensure that lines 209-211 are set as follows to test the impact of text prompts:\n   - args.use_text_prompt = True (to include semantic prompts)\n   - args.use_box_prompt = True (or args.use_point_prompt = True if using point prompts)\n   - args.visualize = True (to see the results)\n3. Run the script with 'bash script/inference_demo.sh' after setting the correct paths in the script for the SegVol checkpoint and work directory.\n4. To compare with and without text prompts, you can run the experiment twice by toggling args.use_text_prompt between True and False in inference_demo.py line 209."
