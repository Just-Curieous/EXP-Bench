      "question": "Does the zoom-out-zoom-in mechanism offer superior segmentation accuracy and efficiency compared to the simple resize strategy and the sliding window algorithm when evaluated using the AMOS22 dataset on 15 major organs?",
      "method": "Using the AMOS22 dataset with 48 cases covering 15 major organs, perform segmentation experiments comparing three approaches: (a) a simple resize strategy, (b) a sliding window approach that scans the entire 3D CT with thousands of windows, and (c) a zoom-out-zoom-in mechanism that conducts one global inference on the full 3D CT followed by targeted local scanning using dozens of windows. Performance is assessed by computing the Dice score and recording the inference time per case on the same 20% test split.",
      "expected_outcome": "The zoom-out-zoom-in mechanism is expected to achieve the best average Dice score while maintaining a competitive inference speed compared to the simple resize approach. Additionally, it should be far more efficient than the sliding window method in terms of computational cost, as it reduces the number of windows scanned.",

Update the 'categories' field to include all 15 organ names.\n2. Update the inference_demo.sh script with the path to the SegVol checkpoint and desired output directory.\n3. To compare the three approaches, run the script three times with different configurations:\n   a) For the simple resize strategy: Set args.use_zoom_in = False in line 208 of inference_demo.py\n   b) For the sliding window approach: Comment out lines 73-105 in inference_demo.py (the zoom-out part) and modify the sliding_window_inference call to scan the entire image\n   c) For the zoom-out-zoom-in mechanism: Keep the default setting with args.use_zoom_in = True\n4. Execute each configuration using 'bash script/inference_demo.sh' and compare the Dice scores and inference times printed in the output.",
