    "no_answer": "After thoroughly examining the repository, I could not find a specific script that directly answers the experiment question about SegVol's ability to classify semantic categories based on spatial prompts. While the inference_demo.py script contains functionality for running SegVol with different prompt types (point, box, text) and the model.py shows the TextEncoder class that handles semantic information, there is no dedicated script that specifically implements the semantic category classification experiment described in the question. The case study mentioned in section 3.4 of the paper appears to be a specialized experiment that is not directly available as a standalone script in the repository. The repository contains the core model implementation but lacks specific scripts for reproducing the particular experiment about semantic category classification of segmentation results based on spatial prompts."
