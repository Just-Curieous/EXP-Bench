    "usage_instructions": "To conduct the experiment comparing the three segmentation methods (simple resize, sliding window, and zoom-out-zoom-in), modify the inference_demo.py script as follows:\n\n1. For the simple resize method: Set `args.use_zoom_in = False` on line 208\n\n2. For the sliding window method: You would need to modify the script to bypass the zoom-out phase and directly use the sliding_window_inference function from utils/monai_inferers_utils.py on the full-resolution image\n\n3. For the zoom-out-zoom-in method: Use the default setting with `args.use_zoom_in = True` on line 208\n\nFor each configuration, run the script with appropriate CT data using the command: `bash script/inference_demo.sh`. The script will output Dice scores for each method. To measure inference time, you can add timing code around the inference sections.\n\nNote that the paper reports median Dice scores of approximately 0.4509 for simple resize, 0.6529 for sliding window, and 0.7298 for zoom-out-zoom-in, with inference times of 65ms, 3331ms, and 190ms per case respectively when run on 8 NVIDIA A100-SXM4-40GB GPUs."
