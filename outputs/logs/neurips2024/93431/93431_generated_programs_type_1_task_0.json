    "no_answer": "After thoroughly searching the repository, I could not find any script or set of scripts that specifically answer the experiment question about comparing OptoPrime (Trace) with Adam in classical differentiable optimization problems, including a variant that does not see the computational graph (Trace Masked). While the repository contains various examples and tutorials demonstrating the use of OptoPrime and other optimizers, none directly address the specific synthetic numerical optimization task described in the question with the 30 randomized trials and comparative evaluation against Adam and a masked variant."
