    "no_answer": "While the repository contains a notebook (/workspace/docs/examples/numerical/numerical_optimization.ipynb) that implements traffic light optimization using Trace and includes functionality to run with or without memory (via the trace_memory parameter), it does not contain a complete script or set of scripts that directly compares all the methods mentioned in the experiment question (Trace with memory, Trace without memory, SCATS, GP, and PSO). The notebook demonstrates how to use Trace for traffic optimization but doesn't include the comparative evaluation with all these methods. The paper mentions this experiment, but the corresponding comprehensive comparison code doesn't appear to be included in the repository."
