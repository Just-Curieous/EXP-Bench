    "no_answer": "While the repository contains a traffic light optimization example in `/workspace/docs/examples/numerical/numerical_optimization.ipynb` that uses UXSim to optimize traffic light durations at a four-way intersection, it doesn't explicitly compare Trace with memory vs. Trace NoMem (OptoPrime without memory). The notebook includes functionality to set memory size via the `trace_memory` parameter in the `run_approach` function, but it only demonstrates a single run with `trace_memory=0` (no memory). To answer the experiment question, one would need to modify the notebook to run the comparison with different memory settings (e.g., run once with `trace_memory=0` and once with a positive value like `trace_memory=5`), which goes beyond simply executing existing scripts."
