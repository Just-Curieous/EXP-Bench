            "hypothesis": "Does providing full access to the computational graph in OptoPrime (Trace) improve its capability to solve classical differentiable optimization problems compared to using feedback-only (Trace Masked)?",
            "method": "Construct a synthetic optimization environment where the task is to minimize |h(x) - y*|, with y* being randomly generated and h defined by a computational graph with arbitrarily complex connections. Implement two variants: one where the optimizer (Trace) has full access to the computational graph and another (Trace Masked) that only receives feedback in the form of relative information (i.e., whether the output should be larger or smaller, equivalent to gradient feedback). Ensure no memory from past trials is maintained. Run 30 independent trials using the same set of randomly created problems to ensure consistency. Record convergence metrics such as the number of iterations to reach a threshold error and the final optimization error. Compare the performance of the two variants to assess the impact of having graph access.",
            "expected_outcome": "It is expected that the full-access variant (Trace) will match the performance of classical optimizers like Adam, showing fast and reliable convergence. In contrast, the Trace Masked variant should struggle to find the optimal x*, demonstrating that the absence of the computational graph significantly degrades optimization performance.",

Implement both the Trace version of OptoPrime and the Adam optimizer. Keep all experimental settings identical, including running 30 trials with the same random seeds to control for inherent randomness. Collect detailed performance metrics such as convergence speed (iterations to reach a specified error tolerance) and final optimization error. Perform statistical comparisons on the results to determine if there is a significant difference in performance between the two optimizers.",

Define the two trainable parameters as the green light durations (integers in the range [15, 90]) for the two traffic flow directions. Initialize both variants: Trace (with memory) and Trace NoMem (without memory) using identical starting parameters. Run both optimizers for a fixed number of iterations (e.g., 50 iterations), and at each iteration measure the estimated total vehicle delay caused at the intersection. Plot the convergence curves (delay versus iterations) and compute the absolute error relative to a known or estimated optimum. Optionally, run multiple trials to compute statistical measures (mean and standard deviation) of the performance metrics.",

Run the following optimizers: Trace, SCATS, Gaussian Process Minimization (GP), and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). For each method, track the estimated delay in traffic across a fixed number of iterations (e.g., 50 iterations). Record the convergence behavior (delay vs. iterations) and the absolute errors of the parameter settings. Compare the performance profiles to determine which optimizer reduces delays faster and more effectively. In particular, note that GP and PSO might require additional iterations to converge; ensure that the experimental protocol documents this limitation.",
