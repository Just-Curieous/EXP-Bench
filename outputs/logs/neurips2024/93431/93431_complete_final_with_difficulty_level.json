These tasks are standard procedural steps necessary for conducting experiments but do not involve implementing the core novel optimization methods. Core components include implementing the learning function that optimizes prompts based on feedback (Step 7), which directly relates to the novel contribution of the Trace framework and the generative optimization approach. Implementing the chain-of-thought prediction module (Step 5) can be considered core as it involves logic specific to the novel method's application in LLM interaction. Creating a base class for language model interaction (Step 3) also relates to the novel generative optimization method. None of the components are ambiguous as the requirements for each step are clearly defined and do not require significant inference or guesswork."

This includes defining model classes with trainable prompt templates and functions, and implementing an optimization loop that iteratively improves both prompts and functions based on feedback. These aspects require understanding and implementing the new method introduced in the paper.

The core component is the implementation of the 'optimize_policy' function using the Trace package, which is central to demonstrating the generative optimization capabilities of the novel OptoPrime optimizer.

The main research contribution, as described in the title and abstract, is a novel generative optimization framework called OptoPrime using execution traces within the optimizer. Therefore, components directly involved in implementing or adapting OptoPrime for the comparison are considered core. Specifically, Step 7 and Step 9 involve implementing the optimization logic using Trace's OptoPrime and TextGrad's optimizers, which align with the novel contribution of the paper. Other steps primarily involve orchestration tasks such as setting up environments, defining command-line arguments, initializing models, loading datasets, and processing results. These are non-core as they support the execution but do not implement the novel optimization framework itself. There is no ambiguity in the components as the detailed requirements provide sufficient clarity on implementation steps."

The core components are writing the function decorated with @bundle(trainable=True) to implement the 'strange sort' algorithm and setting up the optimization loop using OptoPrime. These components are essential as they directly relate to the novel contribution of using Trace for optimization. The non-core components include importing necessary modules, creating test cases, defining a feedback function, initializing the optimizer, executing the function with test inputs, providing feedback, breaking the loop upon correct output, and verifying the optimized function. These are orchestration steps that support the experiment but do not involve implementing the core algorithm or optimization method itself. There are no ambiguous components as the detailed requirements provide clear instructions for each step."
