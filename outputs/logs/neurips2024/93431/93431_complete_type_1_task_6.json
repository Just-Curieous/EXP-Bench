      "question": "- **Can Trace (OptoPrime with memory) effectively optimize long-horizon robotic control tasks, outperforming OPRO and OptoPrime without memory? There are 3 tasks to be evaluated: Reach, Pick-place, and Push. These all belong to the Meta-World environment from LLF-Bench.**",
      "method": "1. **Task Setup:**  \n   - **Goal:** Optimize long-horizon control for a **simulated Sawyer robot manipulator** in Meta-World (LLF-Bench).  \n   - **Tasks Considered:**  \n     - **Reach**: Move the robot\u2019s end-effector to a target position.  \n     - **Pick-place**: Pick up an object and place it at a designated position.  \n     - **Push**: Push an object to a goal location.  \n   - **Observation Space:** A dictionary of vectors representing:  \n     - End-effector position  \n     - Goal position  \n     - Gripper status  \n   - **Action Space:** A **4D vector** controlling:  \n     - The relative position of the end-effector  \n     - The gripper state  \n\n2. **Training Setup:**  \n   - **Episodic training**: The robot either **completes the task or times out**.  \n   - **Fixed initial conditions**: All training iterations start with the **same conditions**.  \n   - **Task horizon:** **10 steps per episode**, ensuring tasks can be fully executed.  \n\n3. **Comparative Evaluation:**  \n   - **Trace (OptoPrime with memory)**  \n   - **Trace NoMem (OptoPrime without memory)**  \n   - **OPRO** (proposes one candidate per iteration and receives feedback).  \n\n4. **Feedback Mechanism:**  \n   - OPTO provides **textual feedback** on task success.  \n   - The execution trace records **step-by-step rollout** for better optimization.  \n   - Ablation study: An experiment where **execution traces are masked**, testing their impact on stability and performance.",
      "expected_outcome": "- **Trace (OptoPrime with memory) should be the top-performing optimizer**, particularly in long-horizon tasks requiring multiple steps.  \n- **Trace NoMem (without execution traces) should see a significant drop in performance and stability**, validating the importance of execution traces.  \n- **OPRO should initially perform well in the Reach task but degrade over iterations**, as mentioned in prior studies.  \n- **Trace should generalize well to held-out test conditions**, proving its ability to learn robust control logic.",

      "usage_instructions": "1. Install the required dependencies: `pip install trace-opt` and `pip install -e LLF-Bench/.[metaworld]` (after cloning the LLF-Bench repository).\n2. Set up your OpenAI API key in the notebook.\n3. Modify the `optimize_policy` function to compare the three optimizers:\n   - For Trace (OptoPrime with memory): Use `optimizer = OptoPrime(controller.parameters(), config_list=config_list, memory_size=5)`\n   - For Trace NoMem (OptoPrime without memory): Use `optimizer = OptoPrime(controller.parameters(), config_list=config_list, memory_size=0)`\n   - For OPRO: Use `optimizer = OPRO(controller.parameters(), config_list=config_list)`\n4. Run the notebook with each of the three Meta-World tasks by changing the `env_name` parameter in the `optimize_policy` call:\n   - For Reach: `env_name=\"llf-metaworld-reach-v2\"`\n   - For Pick-place: `env_name=\"llf-metaworld-pick-place-v2\"`\n   - For Push: `env_name=\"llf-metaworld-push-v2\"`\n5. Compare the performance metrics (success rate and returns) across the three optimizers and three tasks.",

Then, create a wrapper for the Meta-World environment that integrates with the trace package for optimization.\n\nImplement a rollout function to evaluate controllers and an optimize_policy function that uses language models to improve a controller's performance. The controller should be a trainable function that maps observations to actions for the robot.\n\nThe core of your implementation should compare three different optimizers:\n1. Trace (OptoPrime with memory_size=5)\n2. Trace NoMem (OptoPrime with memory_size=0)\n3. OPRO\n\nRun experiments with each optimizer on three Meta-World tasks:\n1.
