The notebook includes functionality to set memory size via the `trace_memory` parameter in the `run_approach` function, but it only demonstrates a single run with `trace_memory=0` (no memory).

Solution Optimization Script:\n   - Create a script that optimizes LLM responses to multiple-choice questions at test time\n   - Implement two approaches: the original TextGrad implementation and the OptoPrime implementation\n   - The script should:\n     - Load a task (default: MMLU_machine_learning)\n     - Get initial zero-shot responses from an LLM\n     - Apply iterative optimization to improve responses\n     - Use majority voting to ensemble multiple predictions\n     - Run optimization in parallel using multiple threads\n     - Track and report performance metrics and timing information\n     - Save results to JSON files in a 'textgrad_figures' directory\n   - Support command-line arguments to select the algorithm, task, engine, etc.\n\n2. Prompt Optimization Script:\n   - Create a script that optimizes system prompts for improved LLM performance\n   - Implement TextGrad and OptoPrime approaches for prompt optimization\n   - The script should:\n     - Load a task (default: BBH_object_counting)\n     - Train a system prompt over multiple epochs\n     - Evaluate performance on validation and test sets\n     - Optionally revert to previous prompts if validation performance decreases\n     - Track and report performance metrics and timing information\n     - Save results to JSON files in a 'textgrad_figures' directory\n   - Support command-line arguments to select the algorithm, task, engines, etc.\n\nBoth scripts should be designed to demonstrate that OptoPrime is approximately 3x faster than TextGrad while achieving similar performance. The scripts should use the TextGrad and Opto libraries.",
