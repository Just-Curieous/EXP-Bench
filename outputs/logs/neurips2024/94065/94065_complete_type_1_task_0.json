      "question": "Will the proposed solution **NeuRodin** outperform existing solutions such as **Neuralangelo** under the conditions of *structural integrity* and *parameter efficiency*, particularly in preserving geometrically challenging areas like the barn\u2019s roof in the **Tanks and Temples** dataset?",
      "method": "#### **Problem Setup**\n\n- **Objective**: Validate the claim that NeuRodin achieves higher structural fidelity and surface detail than Neuralangelo, with significantly fewer parameters, by reproducing their results using a controlled benchmarking setup.\n\n#### **Experiment Components**\n\n- **Dataset**:\n  - **Tanks and Temples (T&T)**: Use the training subset (Barn, Caterpillar, Courthouse, Ignatius, Meetingroom, Truck) as well as the advanced subset.\n- **Models Under Comparison**:\n  - NeuRodin\n  - Neuralangelo\n- **Evaluation Metrics**:\n  - Accuracy\n  - Completeness\n  - Precision\n  - Recall\n  - F-score (\u2191 higher is better)\n  - Structural integrity (qualitative inspection of scene structures\u2014e.g., barn roof collapse)\n  - Parameter count (model size)\n- **Hardware Setup**:\n  - Ideally replicate the original authors\u2019 hardware: an A100 40G GPU; if not, note GPU type and VRAM capacity.\n\n#### **Independent Variables**:\n\n- **Reconstruction Framework**: NeuRodin vs. Neuralangelo\n- **Parameter Efficiency**: Number of parameters used\n\n#### **Dependent Variables**:\n\n- F-score and supporting metrics on Tanks and Temples\n- Qualitative structural fidelity in visual reconstructions\n- Inferred or measured number of model parameters\n\n#### **Experimental Steps**:\n\n1. **Implementation Setup**:\n   - Use the [NeuRodin repo](https://github.com/Open3DVLab/NeuRodin)\n   - Use either Neuralangelo\u2019s original code or Bakedangelo if indoor stability is required.\n   - Ensure both models use the same input pipeline, pose files, and training settings (resolution, learning rate, hash grid config).\n2. **Dataset Preparation**:\n   - Download and preprocess Tanks and Temples scenes identically for both methods.\n   - Align camera poses and resolution with NeuRodin\u2019s expectations (consult Appendix G in the paper).\n3. **Training and Mesh Extraction**:\n   - Train both models to convergence using comparable steps.\n   - Extract meshes with **marching cubes** at resolution 2048 for consistency.\n4. **Structural Integrity Analysis**:\n   - Visually inspect the **barn roof** and similar sensitive structures.\n   - Compare collapsing artifacts, noise, and continuity of geometry.\n5. **Parameter Efficiency Check**:\n   - Use Python tools or repository logs to count trainable parameters.\n6. **Evaluation Metrics Computation**:\n   - Use official T&T script for F-score on training scenes.\n   - For advanced subset, submit reconstructions to [T&T server](https://www.tanksandtemples.org/).\n   - Record and present metrics in Table 5 format.",
      "expected_outcome": "- NeuRodin should achieve a higher mean F-score (\u2248 0.51) than Neuralangelo (\u2248 0.50) on the Tanks and Temples training subset.\n- On structurally complex scenes (e.g., Barn), NeuRodin should preserve the roof while Neuralangelo may fail.\n- NeuRodin will use 1/8 fewer parameters than Neuralangelo (Table 1 + Sec. 5.1), making it substantially more efficient.\n- Visual reconstructions from NeuRodin will exhibit better fine-grained detail and smoother surfaces with minimal artifacts.\n- Quantitative edge on the Tanks and Temples *advanced* subset (NeuRodin: 28.84 vs. Neuralangelo: 26.28) as shown in Table 2.",
