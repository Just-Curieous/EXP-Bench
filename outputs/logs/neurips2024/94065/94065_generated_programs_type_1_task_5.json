    "no_answer": "After thoroughly exploring the repository, I couldn't find a specific script or set of scripts that directly compare NeuRodin's reconstruction performance with MonoSDF-MLP and MonoSDF-Grid on ScanNet++ scenes in terms of Accuracy, Completeness, Precision, Recall, and F-score. The repository contains implementations of NeuRodin and MonoSDF models, as well as scripts for training models and extracting meshes (like zoo/extract_surface.py), but there doesn't appear to be a dedicated evaluation script that performs the specific comparison requested in the experiment question. While the repository includes tools for mesh extraction and some evaluation capabilities, it lacks a comprehensive benchmark script that would compare these specific metrics across the three models on ScanNet++ data."
