Define the SDF function that will be used for marching cubes.\n5. Extract the mesh using the extract_mesh function from mesh_utils.py with the specified resolution.\n6.

Run the first stage training using the neurodin-stage1-outdoor-large configuration with the appropriate scene name (e.g., Barn).\n3. After the first stage completes, run the second stage training using the neurodin-stage2-outdoor-large configuration, loading the checkpoint from the first stage.\n4. Both stages should use the same dataset and scene name, with the second stage building upon the results of the first stage.\n5. The training will produce checkpoints that can be used for mesh extraction and rendering."

Generate a camera path, either a spiral path or from a JSON file.\n5. Render the trajectory by generating rays for each camera position and evaluating the model.\n6.

Apply marching cubes to extract the surface where the SDF value is zero.\n6. Combine the mesh blocks into a single mesh.\n7. Optionally filter the mesh to remove parts outside a bounding sphere or keep only the largest connected component.\n8. Return the final mesh object."
