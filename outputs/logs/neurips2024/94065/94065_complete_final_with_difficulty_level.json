            "method": "#### **Problem Setup**\n\n- **Objective**: Validate the claim that NeuRodin achieves higher structural fidelity and surface detail than Neuralangelo, with significantly fewer parameters, by reproducing their results using a controlled benchmarking setup.\n\n#### **Experiment Components**\n\n- **Dataset**:\n  - **Tanks and Temples (T&T)**: Use the training subset (Barn, Caterpillar, Courthouse, Ignatius, Meetingroom, Truck) as well as the advanced subset.\n- **Models Under Comparison**:\n  - NeuRodin\n  - Neuralangelo\n- **Evaluation Metrics**:\n  - Accuracy\n  - Completeness\n  - Precision\n  - Recall\n  - F-score (\u2191 higher is better)\n  - Structural integrity (qualitative inspection of scene structures\u2014e.g., barn roof collapse)\n  - Parameter count (model size)\n- **Hardware Setup**:\n  - Ideally replicate the original authors\u2019 hardware: an A100 40G GPU; if not, note GPU type and VRAM capacity.\n\n#### **Independent Variables**:\n\n- **Reconstruction Framework**: NeuRodin vs. Neuralangelo\n- **Parameter Efficiency**: Number of parameters used\n\n#### **Dependent Variables**:\n\n- F-score and supporting metrics on Tanks and Temples\n- Qualitative structural fidelity in visual reconstructions\n- Inferred or measured number of model parameters\n\n#### **Experimental Steps**:\n\n1. **Implementation Setup**:\n   - Use the [NeuRodin repo](https://github.com/Open3DVLab/NeuRodin)\n   - Use either Neuralangelo\u2019s original code or Bakedangelo if indoor stability is required.\n   - Ensure both models use the same input pipeline, pose files, and training settings (resolution, learning rate, hash grid config).\n2. **Dataset Preparation**:\n   - Download and preprocess Tanks and Temples scenes identically for both methods.\n   - Align camera poses and resolution with NeuRodin\u2019s expectations (consult Appendix G in the paper).\n3. **Training and Mesh Extraction**:\n   - Train both models to convergence using comparable steps.\n   - Extract meshes with **marching cubes** at resolution 2048 for consistency.\n4. **Structural Integrity Analysis**:\n   - Visually inspect the **barn roof** and similar sensitive structures.\n   - Compare collapsing artifacts, noise, and continuity of geometry.\n5. **Parameter Efficiency Check**:\n   - Use Python tools or repository logs to count trainable parameters.\n6. **Evaluation Metrics Computation**:\n   - Use official T&T script for F-score on training scenes.\n   - For advanced subset, submit reconstructions to [T&T server](https://www.tanksandtemples.org/).\n   - Record and present metrics in Table 5 format.",
            "expected_outcome": "- NeuRodin should achieve a higher mean F-score (\u2248 0.51) than Neuralangelo (\u2248 0.50) on the Tanks and Temples training subset.\n- On structurally complex scenes (e.g., Barn), NeuRodin should preserve the roof while Neuralangelo may fail.\n- NeuRodin will use 1/8 fewer parameters than Neuralangelo (Table 1 + Sec. 5.1), making it substantially more efficient.\n- Visual reconstructions from NeuRodin will exhibit better fine-grained detail and smoother surfaces with minimal artifacts.\n- Quantitative edge on the Tanks and Temples *advanced* subset (NeuRodin: 28.84 vs. Neuralangelo: 26.28) as shown in Table 2.",

The mesh extraction script includes core components, particularly the implementation of the novel two-stage model and the extraction of the signed distance function (SDF) from the model, which are integral to the novel method's high-fidelity reconstruction capabilities. The mesh generation using the marching cubes algorithm and handling special cases for the Tanks and Temples dataset are non-core, as they are standard evaluation procedures. Overall, the novel contribution of the paper, NeuRodin, requires implementing specific innovative strategies within the mesh extraction script, making those components core.

The main research contribution of NeuRodin is its framework for high-fidelity neural surface reconstruction, specifically addressing deficiencies in SDF-based methods. The method outlined involves several steps, most of which are non-core orchestration steps such as command-line argument parsing, model loading, grid creation, and mesh extraction using existing algorithms like marching cubes, which are standard procedures and not part of implementing the novel method itself. The core component identified is the definition of the SDF using the model's neural network, as this directly relates to the novel framework introduced. There is no ambiguity in the description provided for any component, as all steps are clearly specified with references to script sections that detail implementation."

                    "score_explanation": "The paper introduces NeuRodin, a novel two-stage neural surface reconstruction framework. The task involves implementing a function to extract a 3D mesh using the marching cubes algorithm from an SDF neural network. Although the novel contribution of the paper is NeuRodin's framework, the task itself focuses on using existing methods (marching cubes algorithm) and libraries (numpy, torch, etc.) to achieve mesh extraction. Most components like importing libraries, creating a data loader, combining mesh blocks, and filtering are orchestration steps that support the task but do not implement the novel method. The core components are the implementation of the marching cubes algorithm and evaluating the SDF function, as they directly relate to the surface extraction process, which is central to the method discussed in the paper. All components are well-specified with no ambiguity, as the requirements detail each step clearly."
