      "question": "Does explicit bias correction improve surface accuracy in SDF-to-density conversion across various renderers, such as NeuS, VolSDF, and TUVR, especially in handling bias-induced artifacts like ceiling collapses?",
      "method": "#### **Problem Setup**\n\nValidate the versatility of explicit bias correction by integrating it into the coarse stage of three SDF-based renderers and comparing performance with and without correction. Emphasis is on improvements in reconstruction accuracy and fidelity on high-quality indoor RGB captures.\n\n#### **Experiment Components**\n\n- **Renderers Under Evaluation**:\n  - NeuS\n  - VolSDF\n  - TUVR\n- **Bias Correction Conditions**:\n  - With explicit bias correction (NeuRodin\u2019s Equation 8)\n  - Without correction (baseline)\n- **Dataset & Imaging**:\n  - Scenes: Diverse indoor scenes with structural elements (e.g., flat ceilings, sharp edges)\n  - Images: Captured using DSLR cameras, simulating high-fidelity RGB inputs\n  - Image Preprocessing:\n    - With prior knowledge: Downsample images based on feature distribution or semantic priors\n    - Without prior knowledge: Uniform downsampling and cropping\n- **Evaluation Metrics**:\n  - Accuracy (Acc): Distance from predicted surface to GT\n  - Completeness (Comp): Distance from GT to predicted surface\n  - Precision (Pred) and Recall (Rec): Thresholded surface overlap\n  - F-score (\u2191): Harmonic mean of precision and recall\n\n#### **Independent Variables**\n\n- Renderer type: NeuS, VolSDF, TUVR\n- Bias correction status: Enabled vs Disabled\n- Downsampling strategy: With vs Without prior knowledge\n\n#### **Dependent Variables**\n\nSurface quality metrics:\n\n- Accuracy (Acc)\n- Completeness (Comp)\n- Precision (Pred)\n- Recall (Rec)\n- F-score\n\n#### **Experimental Steps**\n\n1. **Renderer Configuration**:\n   - Prepare NeuS, VolSDF, and TUVR with default pipelines.\n   - Add NeuRodin\u2019s explicit bias correction module to the **coarse optimization stage** only.\n2. **Image Acquisition & Processing**:\n   - Capture DSLR images or use high-resolution indoor scans from ScanNet++.\n   - Preprocess images via two strategies:\n     - **Prior-aware**: Downsample based on spatial texture or depth features\n     - **Naive**: Uniform resolution reduction and centered cropping\n3. **Training & Mesh Extraction**:\n   - Train each renderer variant (with and without correction) for a fixed number of steps.\n   - Extract meshes via marching cubes (resolution 2048 or consistent).\n4. **Evaluation & Visualization**:\n   - Compute all metrics using ground truth point clouds (e.g., from laser scans).\n   - Compare depth maps, especially in regions prone to density collapse (e.g., ceilings).\n   - Visualize cases like Figure 9 from NeuRodin to highlight correction impact.",
      "expected_outcome": "Explicit bias correction is expected to:\n\n- Eliminate ceiling collapses and other biased artifacts present in default SDF-to-density modeling.\n- Yield higher F-scores, greater precision, and improved completeness, especially in challenging indoor settings.\n- Generalize effectively across NeuS, VolSDF, and TUVR, proving itself as a renderer-agnostic enhancement.",
