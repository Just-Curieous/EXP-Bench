    "no_answer": "While the repository contains implementations of all the models mentioned in the experiment question (NeuRodin, VolSDF, NeuS, and Neuralangelo) and provides scripts for training these models on ScanNet++ data and extracting meshes, it does not include a specific script or set of scripts that directly compares the F-score of these methods on the ScanNet++ dataset. The repository includes tools for extracting meshes (zoo/extract_surface.py and scripts/extract_mesh.py), but lacks scripts for computing F-score metrics or performing the specific benchmark comparison described in the experiment question. The evaluation methodology described in the question would likely require using external tools or custom scripts to compute F-scores between the extracted meshes and ground truth data, which are not provided in this repository."
