      "method": "#### **Problem Setup**\n\n- **Objective**: Validate the claim that NeuRodin achieves higher structural fidelity and surface detail than Neuralangelo, with significantly fewer parameters, by reproducing their results using a controlled benchmarking setup.\n\n#### **Experiment Components**\n\n- **Dataset**:\n  - **Tanks and Temples (T&T)**: Use the training subset (Barn, Caterpillar, Courthouse, Ignatius, Meetingroom, Truck) as well as the advanced subset.\n- **Models Under Comparison**:\n  - NeuRodin\n  - Neuralangelo\n- **Evaluation Metrics**:\n  - Accuracy\n  - Completeness\n  - Precision\n  - Recall\n  - F-score (\u2191 higher is better)\n  - Structural integrity (qualitative inspection of scene structures\u2014e.g., barn roof collapse)\n  - Parameter count (model size)\n- **Hardware Setup**:\n  - Ideally replicate the original authors\u2019 hardware: an A100 40G GPU; if not, note GPU type and VRAM capacity.\n\n#### **Independent Variables**:\n\n- **Reconstruction Framework**: NeuRodin vs. Neuralangelo\n- **Parameter Efficiency**: Number of parameters used\n\n#### **Dependent Variables**:\n\n- F-score and supporting metrics on Tanks and Temples\n- Qualitative structural fidelity in visual reconstructions\n- Inferred or measured number of model parameters\n\n#### **Experimental Steps**:\n\n1. **Implementation Setup**:\n   - Use the [NeuRodin repo](https://github.com/Open3DVLab/NeuRodin)\n   - Use either Neuralangelo\u2019s original code or Bakedangelo if indoor stability is required.\n   - Ensure both models use the same input pipeline, pose files, and training settings (resolution, learning rate, hash grid config).\n2. **Dataset Preparation**:\n   - Download and preprocess Tanks and Temples scenes identically for both methods.\n   - Align camera poses and resolution with NeuRodin\u2019s expectations (consult Appendix G in the paper).\n3. **Training and Mesh Extraction**:\n   - Train both models to convergence using comparable steps.\n   - Extract meshes with **marching cubes** at resolution 2048 for consistency.\n4. **Structural Integrity Analysis**:\n   - Visually inspect the **barn roof** and similar sensitive structures.\n   - Compare collapsing artifacts, noise, and continuity of geometry.\n5. **Parameter Efficiency Check**:\n   - Use Python tools or repository logs to count trainable parameters.\n6. **Evaluation Metrics Computation**:\n   - Use official T&T script for F-score on training scenes.\n   - For advanced subset, submit reconstructions to [T&T server](https://www.tanksandtemples.org/).\n   - Record and present metrics in Table 5 format.",
      "expected_outcome": "- NeuRodin should achieve a higher mean F-score (\u2248 0.51) than Neuralangelo (\u2248 0.50) on the Tanks and Temples training subset.\n- On structurally complex scenes (e.g., Barn), NeuRodin should preserve the roof while Neuralangelo may fail.\n- NeuRodin will use 1/8 fewer parameters than Neuralangelo (Table 1 + Sec. 5.1), making it substantially more efficient.\n- Visual reconstructions from NeuRodin will exhibit better fine-grained detail and smoother surfaces with minimal artifacts.\n- Quantitative edge on the Tanks and Temples *advanced* subset (NeuRodin: 28.84 vs. Neuralangelo: 26.28) as shown in Table 2.",

      "random_uncertainty": {
        "source": "Variability in training initialization and data augmentation",
        "description": "Random factors such as stochastic gradient updates, random data augmentation (e.g., random cropping or slight variations in image preprocessing), and inherent randomness in model initialization can lead to fluctuations in the reconstruction quality metrics. This may result in unstable gradient updates and variation in the quantitative metrics (Accuracy, Completeness, Precision, Recall, F-score) across different training runs.",
        "impact": "Results may vary from run to run; metrics in tables (e.g., Table 5 showing quantitative performance) could exhibit inconsistency and error bars may not fully capture this randomness if not averaged over enough trials.",
        "possible_modifications": [
          "Fix random seeds and ensure deterministic data augmentation pipelines to reduce run-to-run variability.",
          "Perform multiple runs with diverse seeds and report averaged results with proper statistical measures to capture this uncertainty.",
          "Avoid unnecessary random perturbations (such as dropping tokens or introducing unneeded noise) during training."

      "systematic_uncertainty": {
        "source": "Bias in scene selection and integration of depth priors",
        "description": "The experiment uses only 3\u20135 scenes out of 8 available from the ScanNet++ dataset and leaves ambiguous the criteria for scene selection, which may introduce non-representative sampling. Additionally, the exact implementation of integrating pretrained depth priors in MonoSDF-MLP and MonoSDF-Grid is not fully detailed, potentially leading to systematic bias in performance evaluation.",
        "impact": "This systematic uncertainty could skew the comparative results between NeuRodin and strong prior-based methods. If the selected scenes are not truly representative, or if the methodology of integrating priors introduces consistent bias, the reported metrics (as detailed in the expected outcomes) might be systematically shifted, affecting reproducibility and generalizability.",
        "possible_modifications": [
          "Define and adhere to clear selection criteria for scenes to ensure diverse and representative sampling.",
          "Provide detailed documentation for how pretrained depth priors are integrated to remove ambiguities in the experimental setup.",
          "Introduce a standardized scoring system for qualitative evaluations (e.g., assessing flatness, noise, and structural preservation) to minimize subjective bias."
