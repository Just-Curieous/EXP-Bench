  "requirements": [
    "Step 1: Set up the environment with Python 3.8, PyTorch 1.12.1 with CUDA 11.3, and other dependencies including tiny-cuda-nn and PyMCubes (/workspace/README.md:37-75)",
    "Step 2: Download and prepare the Tanks and Temples dataset following the Neuralangelo data processing guide, organizing it with images and transforms.json in a scene-specific folder (/workspace/README.md:79-90)",
    "Step 3: Train the first stage of the NeuRodin model using the neurodin-stage1-outdoor-large configuration with the appropriate scene name from the Tanks and Temples dataset (/workspace/README.md:125-126)",
    "Step 4: After the first stage completes, train the second stage using the neurodin-stage2-outdoor-large configuration, loading the checkpoint from the first stage (/workspace/README.md:128-129)",
    "Step 5: Extract the surface mesh from the trained model using the extract_surface.py script with appropriate resolution (/workspace/README.md:161-164)"

  "agent_instructions": "Your task is to train a NeuRodin model on an outdoor scene from the Tanks and Temples dataset. NeuRodin is a two-stage neural surface reconstruction framework designed to achieve high-fidelity surface reconstruction.\n\nFollow these steps:\n\n1. Set up the environment:\n   - Create a conda environment with Python 3.8\n   - Install PyTorch with CUDA support\n   - Install the tiny-cuda-nn bindings for PyTorch\n   - Install SDFStudio and PyMCubes\n\n2. Prepare the Tanks and Temples dataset:\n   - Download the camera poses and image set from the Tanks and Temples website\n   - Process the data following the Neuralangelo data processing guide\n   - Ensure the data is organized with images and transforms.json in a scene-specific folder\n\n3. Train the NeuRodin model in two stages:\n   - First stage: Use the neurodin-stage1-outdoor-large configuration with your chosen outdoor scene (e.g., Barn)\n   - Second stage: Use the neurodin-stage2-outdoor-large configuration, loading the checkpoint from the first stage\n   - Both stages should use the same dataset and scene name\n\n4. Extract the surface mesh:\n   - Use the extract_surface.py script to generate the final 3D mesh from the trained model\n\nThe output will be a high-fidelity 3D surface reconstruction of the outdoor scene."
