    "no_answer": "While the repository contains implementations of QMIX for both JaxMARL and references to PyMARL, and includes benchmarking scripts that compare JaxMARL with other frameworks (like PettingZoo), I couldn't find a specific script that directly compares JaxMARL and PyMARL on the MPE Simple Spread task using QMIX with 1024 training runs for JaxMARL and 1 for PyMARL. The repository has the components needed to create such a comparison (QMIX implementation, MPE environments, parallel training capabilities), but no ready-made script that answers the specific experiment question about the 21,500Ã— speedup factor mentioned in the question."
