Therefore, all components listed are for orchestrating the experiment, such as importing libraries, defining a benchmark function, initializing parameters, running the benchmark, compiling with jax.jit, calculating steps per second, and visualizing results. None of these require implementing the novel method or algorithm introduced by the paper, thus they are all non-core components. Additionally, the requirements are sufficiently detailed, so none are marked as ambiguous."

This implementation should enable training agents that can solve cooperative tasks with improved sample efficiency compared to independent learners.\n\nHere's what you need to implement:\n\n1. Create a recurrent neural network architecture:\n   - Implement a GRU-based RNN module that can process sequential observations\n   - Build a Q-network that uses this RNN to handle temporal dependencies in the environment\n\n2. Set up the training environment:\n   - Use a multi-agent environment (like MPE, SMAX, or Overcooked)\n   - Wrap the environment with a centralized training wrapper that allows for team rewards\n\n3. Implement the core VDN algorithm:\n   - Create a replay buffer to store experience transitions\n   - Implement epsilon-greedy exploration with a decaying schedule\n   - Sample batches from the replay buffer for training\n   - Calculate Q-values for each agent using the RNN architecture\n   - Implement the VDN mechanism by summing individual agent Q-values to get a joint Q-value\n   - Use this joint Q-value for training (the key insight of VDN)\n   - Implement double Q-learning with a target network that is periodically updated\n\n4. Training and evaluation:\n   - Implement the main training loop that collects experiences and updates the network\n   - Create an evaluation function to test the performance of the greedy policy\n   - Track relevant metrics like episode returns, loss values, and Q-values\n\nThe implementation should be able to handle partially observable environments where agents have limited information, which is why the RNN component is crucial. The VDN approach allows agents to learn cooperative behavior while maintaining decentralized execution during testing.",

These steps directly implement the novel approach described in the paper and therefore are classified as core. All other steps, such as setting up the environment, initializing networks and optimizers, creating a replay buffer, implementing exploration, and training loops, are considered non-core as they support the execution of the experiment but do not implement the novel contribution.
