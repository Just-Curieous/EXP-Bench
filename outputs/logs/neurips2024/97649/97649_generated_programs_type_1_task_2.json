Run the benchmark section of the notebook (Part 2) which compares JaxMARL and PettingZoo implementations.\n4. The script will automatically measure and compare steps-per-second for both implementations across different parallelization levels (1, 100, 1000, 10000 environments).\n5. Results will be displayed showing the performance comparison between JaxMARL (GPU-accelerated) and the original CPU-based PettingZoo implementation."
