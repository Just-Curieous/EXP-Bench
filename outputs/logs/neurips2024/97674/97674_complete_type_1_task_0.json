      "method": "Collect evaluation data by grouping the multimodal documents into several context length bins (e.g., 1K\u20132K, 2K\u20134K, up to 64K tokens). For each bin, measure model performance (accuracy for retrieval and reasoning; soft accuracy for counting) on the same set of questions. Analyze the trend by comparing performance metrics across the bins for each model and task. Include statistical significance tests to verify whether longer contexts consistently result in worse performance, as suggested by the heatmap trends in Fig. 3.\n  \n1. **Task Setup:**  \n   - **Goal:** Compare Trace and TextGrad for AI workflow optimization.  \n   - **Key Difference Between Methods:**  \n     - **Trace propagates minimal subgraphs** to separate tracing infrastructure from optimization algorithms.  \n     - **TextGrad propagates text feedback**, tightly coupling infrastructure and optimization.   \n\n2. **Experimental Design for Fair Comparison:**  \n   - Applied **Trace directly to the evaluation code released with the TextGrad library**.  \n   - Both frameworks used the **same LLM APIs at around the same time** to ensure fairness.  \n   - **Optimization Tasks Compared:**  \n     - **Solution Optimization** (TextGrad Table 2).  \n     - **Prompt Optimization** (TextGrad Table 3).  \n\n3. **Comparative Evaluation:**  \n   - **OptoPrime (Trace\u2019s optimizer)**  \n   - **TextGrad (original implementation)**",
      "expected_outcome": "It is expected that performance will steadily degrade as the context length increases, particularly for tasks requiring high-level reasoning and counting. The decline should be observable in all models, with some models exhibiting a collapse (e.g., generating gibberish) when the context is extremely long.\n  \n- **OptoPrime should be approximately 3x faster than TextGrad**, since:  \n  - OptoPrime makes **one LLM call per optimization step**.  \n  - TextGrad makes **a number of LLM calls proportional to the graph\u2019s size**.",
