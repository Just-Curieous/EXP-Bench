      "question": "- **Does incorporating a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) module improve text needle retrieval performance but not improve image needle retrieval in MLLMs like InternVL-1.5?**\n\n\n- **Does incorporating a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) module improve text needle retrieval performance but not improve image needle retrieval in MLLMs like InternVL-1.5?**",
      "method": "Use InternVL-1.5 and its RAG-enhanced variant to run evaluations on both text and image needle tasks. First, evaluate text needle retrieval, counting, and reasoning tasks with and without the RAG method, recording the accuracy metrics. Then, perform similar evaluations for image needle tasks. Compare the metrics to determine if RAG significantly boosts performance in text-based queries while leaving image-based tasks unaffected or degraded. Document qualitative failure cases, particularly noting if extracted content for image needles is incomplete due to document chunking in the RAG module.\n  \n1. **Task Setup:**  \n   - **Goal:** Compare Trace and TextGrad for AI workflow optimization.  \n   - **Key Difference Between Methods:**  \n     - **Trace propagates minimal subgraphs** to separate tracing infrastructure from optimization algorithms.  \n     - **TextGrad propagates text feedback**, tightly coupling infrastructure and optimization.   \n\n2. **Experimental Design for Fair Comparison:**  \n   - Applied **Trace directly to the evaluation code released with the TextGrad library**.  \n   - Both frameworks used the **same LLM APIs at around the same time** to ensure fairness.  \n   - **Optimization Tasks Compared:**  \n     - **Solution Optimization** (TextGrad Table 2).  \n     - **Prompt Optimization** (TextGrad Table 3).  \n\n3. **Comparative Evaluation:**  \n   - **OptoPrime (Trace\u2019s optimizer)**  \n   - **TextGrad (original implementation)**",
      "expected_outcome": "The expected outcome is that the RAG-enhanced model will show a substantial improvement in performance on text needle tasks (as shown by higher accuracy scores) but will not exhibit similar improvements on image needle tasks. This will support the claim that RAG methods might not be suitable when comprehensive image comprehension is required.\n  \n- **OptoPrime should be approximately 3x faster than TextGrad**, since:  \n  - OptoPrime makes **one LLM call per optimization step**.  \n  - TextGrad makes **a number of LLM calls proportional to the graph\u2019s size**.",
