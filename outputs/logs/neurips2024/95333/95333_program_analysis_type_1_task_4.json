Create a Python evaluation script that:\n   - Takes a model name as input parameter\n   - Loads the specified model (either with or without the STD module)\n   - Loads test data from the DL3DV dataset\n   - Renders 9 novel views for each test scene using the loaded model\n   - Calculates three evaluation metrics: PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS by comparing rendered views with ground truth views\n   - Computes average metrics across all scenes\n   - Saves the evaluation results to a JSON file\n\n2. Create a shell script that:\n   - Takes a model name as input parameter\n   - Runs the Python evaluation script with the specified model\n   - Displays a summary of the results\n\nThe system should be used to evaluate two models:\n- A base video diffusion model named 'nodropout_camP'\n- An enhanced model with the STD module named 'nodropout_camP_STD'\n\nThe evaluation results will be used to determine the impact of the STD module on fine-grained texture enhancement and novel view rendering quality.",
