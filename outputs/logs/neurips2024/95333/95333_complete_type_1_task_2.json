First, use the inference_svd_test.py script to generate results with and without real images as reference views:\n   - For the version WITH real images as reference views, run:\n     ```\n     python inference_svd_test.py --scene /path/to/scene_list.txt --root_path /path/to/dataset --ref_path /path/to/reference_images --model_path /path/to/model_checkpoint --output_path /path/to/output_with_real_refs --num_views [3/6/9/12] --datatype DL3DV\n     ```\n   - For the version WITHOUT real images (using only video diffusion priors), modify the script to skip loading real reference images by commenting out lines 192-193 in inference_svd_test.py which are:\n     ```\n     condition_pixel_values[0, :, :, :] = ref_pixel_values[0, :, :, :]\n     condition_pixel_values[-1, :, :, :] = ref_pixel_values[-1, :, :, :]\n     ```\n     Then run the same command as above but with a different output path.\n\n2. After generating both sets of results, use the eval.py script to evaluate the performance metrics:\n   ```\n   python eval.py --method with_real_refs\n   python eval.py --method without_real_refs\n   ```\n\nThe eval.py script will compute PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS metrics for both approaches across the DL3DV test set with different input view configurations (3, 6, 9, and 12 views). The results will be saved to text files that you can compare to determine which approach performs better.",
