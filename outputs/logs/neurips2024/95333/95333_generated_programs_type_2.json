Call train_render.py with appropriate arguments: --scene_path (path to the 3D scene), --output_path (where to save the generated dataset), --num_samples (list of view counts to generate, e.g., [3, 6, 9, 24]), --use_lr (flag to generate low-resolution renderings), and --port (for distributed training).\n3. The script will first train low-resolution 3D Gaussian Splatting models for each specified number of views using train_lr().\n4. Then it will render paired low-quality and high-quality images using render_lr_hr_pairs().\n5. The resulting dataset will be organized in the output directory with separate folders for each number of views."

The script will load the pre-trained model, process each scene in the text file, and generate enhanced renderings.\n5. The enhanced renderings will be saved in the specified output directory with the same structure as the input."
