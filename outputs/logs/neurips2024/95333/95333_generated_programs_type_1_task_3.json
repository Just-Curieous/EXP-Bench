    "no_answer": "After thoroughly exploring the repository, I found that the code for the 'Confidence-aware 3DGS' component is explicitly listed as 'Not available yet' in the README.md (line 28). This is the component that would contain the pixel-level and image-level confidence strategies mentioned in the experiment question. I searched for relevant keywords like 'confidence', 'pixel-level', and 'image-level' throughout the repository but found no matches. The repository contains two main submodules (3dgs_dataset_generator and SVDFor3D), but neither contains code that implements or evaluates the confidence strategies. Therefore, there are no scripts available in this repository that would answer the experiment question about the impact of pixel-level and image-level confidence strategies on the performance of the 3DGS-Enhancer framework."
