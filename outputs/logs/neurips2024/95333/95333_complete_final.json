If the low-quality 3D Gaussian Splatting renderings deviate systematically from those conditions, inherent biases in the model may lead to consistent artifacts or suboptimal enhancements.",
                "impact": "This bias can produce systematic errors in the enhanced renderings, such as over-smoothing or color shifts, that persist across the entire dataset. Such consistent deviations could affect the general applicability of the method to varied real-world scenes.",

                    "Fine-tune the SVD model on a dataset that closely matches the characteristics of the low-quality renderings.",
                    "Adjust the preprocessing steps to better align the input data with the model's expected input distribution.",
                    "Implement and report quantitative metrics (e.g., PSNR, SSIM) to detect and correct systematic deviations in the enhancement process."
