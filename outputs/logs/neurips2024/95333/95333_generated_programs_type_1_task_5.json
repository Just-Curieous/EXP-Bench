    "no_answer": "After thoroughly examining the repository, I couldn't find specific scripts that directly answer the experiment question about the color correction module's impact on novel view rendering quality. The paper shows in Table 4 that the color correction module does improve performance across all metrics (PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS) when added to video diffusion and STD, but the README.md explicitly states that the STD (Spatial-temporal decoder) is 'Not available yet' in the public repository. Additionally, I couldn't find any implementation of the color correction module in the codebase. While the repository contains code for dataset generation and SVD (Stable Video Diffusion) training/inference, the specific components needed to run this ablation experiment are not fully available in the public repository."
