    "no_answer": "While the repository contains components for evaluating 3DGS-Enhancer on the DL3DV dataset with different numbers of input views (3, 6, 9), there is no single script or small set of scripts that directly performs the comparative evaluation against the NeRF-based methods (Mip-NeRF, FreeNeRF, DNGaussian) as specified in the experiment question. The SVDFor3D repository contains scripts for training and evaluating 3DGS-Enhancer (inference.sh, eval.py), and the 3dgs_dataset_generator repository contains metrics.py for calculating PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS, but these would need to be combined with separate implementations of the baseline methods to answer the experiment question. The repository does not include implementations or evaluation scripts for the baseline methods (Mip-NeRF, FreeNeRF, DNGaussian) required for the comparison."
