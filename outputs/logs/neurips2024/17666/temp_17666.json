            "method": "\u2022 Use the CIFAR10 dataset and train a ResNet18 model under various backdoor attack scenarios (e.g., BadNet, Blend, Trojan, CL, SIG, etc.) as described in the paper. \n\u2022 Apply the BaDExpert defense on the trained backdoored models. \n\u2022 Measure the CA and ASR for each attack type by computing CA = P(x, y) where the prediction M(x) equals the true label y (and the backdoor input detection returns 0), and ASR = P(x, y) where backdoored inputs T(x) are misclassified. \n\u2022 Average the metrics over three experimental runs according to the paper\u2019s protocol. \n\u2022 Compare the resulting ASR (targeting around 5.1%) and the CA drop (approximately 0.9%) with the baseline (no-defense) scenario.",
            "expected_outcome": "BaDExpert is expected to reduce the ASR to around 5% on average while dropping the CA only by approximately 0.9%, thereby outperforming other baseline defenses.",

Additionally, include the Natural backdoor attack scenario. For each attack configuration, deploy BaDExpert and record the AUROC values post-defense, comparing these metrics to the non-adaptive attack scenarios as reported. Analyze if the degraded AUROC (e.g., a drop to 87.0% in the case of the tailored BaDExpert-Adap-BadNet attack) is a significant reduction relative to the ~99% AUROC in standard settings.",

First, introduce weakened triggers by blending triggers at low opacity during inference (labelled as the 'Low-Opacity' attack) and measure the corresponding ASR (attack success rate before defense) and AUROC results. Next, implement the tailored adaptive attack\u2014BaDExpert-Adap-BadNet\u2014where the adversary optimizes an asymmetric trigger to minimize activation of the backdoor expert model. For each case, compute and record the key metrics (ASR and AUROC) and compare them against those obtained from other adaptive attack strategies such as TaCT, Adap-Blend, and Adap-Patch.",
