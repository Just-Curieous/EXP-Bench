      "question": "Does the model accurately capture the dynamical content of MD trajectories, specifically in terms of torsion angle relaxation times, autocorrelation behavior at sub-picosecond timescales, and state transition fluxes between metastable states?",
      "method": "#### Problem Setup\n\n- **Objective**: Evaluate the dynamic fidelity of MDGEN-sampled trajectories compared to ground-truth MD, focusing on torsional relaxation timescales, autocorrelation behaviors, and state-level dynamics via MSM fluxes.\n- **System**: Tetrapeptide trajectories from all-atom explicit-solvent MD.\n\n#### Independent Variables\n\n- **Trajectory Type**:\n  - Ground-truth MD trajectory (100 ns)\n  - Model-generated trajectory (100 ns from 10 \u00d7 10 ns segments)\n- **Torsion Angle Category**:\n  - Sidechain torsions\n  - Backbone torsions\n- **Lag Time Range**:\n  - 100 fs to 100 ps\n\n#### Dependent Variables (Evaluation Metrics)\n\n- **Relaxation Times**: Extracted from torsional autocorrelation functions.\n- **Autocorrelation Profile**: Including negative derivatives with respect to log-timescale to capture fast dynamic features.\n- **MSM Flux Matrix Correlation**: Spearman correlation between flux matrices from MSMs built on MD vs. generated data.\n\n#### Experiment Components\n\n- **Trajectory Generation**:\n  - Generate both MD and MDGEN-sampled 100 ns trajectories for a test set of tetrapeptides.\n- **Autocorrelation Analysis**:\n  1. For each torsion angle (\u03c8, \u03c6, \u03c7), compute:\n      \u27e8cos(\u03b8(t) \u2212 \u03b8(t + \u0394t))\u27e9\n      where \u0394t spans 100 fs to 100 ps.\n  2. Estimate **relaxation times** as the lag time where the autocorrelation drops below 1/e of its initial value.\n  3. Separate results for:\n     - Sidechain torsions\n     - Backbone torsions\n  4. Compute the **negative derivative** of the autocorrelation with respect to log-timescale to highlight fine dynamic relaxations and sub-picosecond oscillations.\n- **Markov State Model (MSM) Flux Comparison**:\n  1. Build MSMs by clustering torsion features (via TICA + k-means + PCCA+) from:\n     - Ground-truth MD trajectories\n     - Model-generated trajectories\n  2. Construct **flux matrices** (transition fluxes between metastable states).\n  3. Calculate **Spearman correlation** between MD and MDGEN flux matrices.",
      "expected_outcome": "Torsion Relaxation Times: Strong correlation (close agreement) for sidechain torsions. Reasonable correlation for backbone torsions.\n\nAutocorrelation Behavior: MDGEN should recover sub-picosecond oscillations and detailed dynamic features not captured in sparsely sampled MD.\n\nMSM Flux Matrix: Spearman correlation \u2248 0.67 \u00b1 0.01 between MD and MDGEN flux matrices, indicating effective recovery of high-flux state transitions.",
