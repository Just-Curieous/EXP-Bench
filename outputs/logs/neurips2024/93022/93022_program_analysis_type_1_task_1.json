  "agent_instructions": "Your task is to implement a system for generating and analyzing molecular dynamics trajectories of peptides. The system consists of two main components:\n\n1. A trajectory generation script that:\n   - Takes a pre-trained simulation model checkpoint as input\n   - Loads peptide sequence data from a CSV file\n   - Generates multiple trajectory rollouts for each peptide sequence\n   - Saves the generated trajectories in PDB and XTC formats\n\n2. A trajectory analysis script that:\n   - Compares ground-truth MD trajectories with model-generated trajectories\n   - Calculates metrics including:\n     - Jensen-Shannon divergence between torsion angle distributions\n     - Torsion angle autocorrelation functions (separated for backbone and sidechain)\n     - Time-lagged independent component analysis (TICA)\n     - Markov state models (MSMs) and their transition matrices\n   - Optionally generates plots visualizing the comparisons\n   - Saves all analysis results to a pickle file\n\nThe system should use libraries like MDTraj for trajectory manipulation, PyEMMA for Markov modeling, and standard scientific Python libraries (NumPy, Matplotlib) for calculations and visualization. The analysis should focus on both structural features (torsion angles) and dynamic properties (autocorrelation, state transitions) to evaluate how well the generated trajectories match the ground-truth MD simulations.",
