      "question": "Does replacing the time attention mechanism with a non-causal Hyena operator in the SiT architecture allow the model to generate extremely long, consistent trajectories that capture dynamics over multiple timescales?",
      "method": "#### Problem Setup\n\nAssess whether a non-causal Hyena operator\u2014used in place of time attention within the SiT architecture\u2014enables MDGEN to generate high-fidelity trajectories that span both fast (sub-ps) and slow (tens of ps) dynamical behaviors.\n\n#### Independent Variables\n\n- **Model Architecture**:\n  - SiT with original time attention mechanism\n  - SiT with non-causal Hyena operator\n- **Lag Time Range**:\n  - 100 fs to 100 ps (used in autocorrelation analysis)\n\n#### Dependent Variables (Evaluation Metrics)\n\n- **Trajectory Quality**:\n  - Agreement of **torsional autocorrelation functions** with ground-truth data\n- **Dynamical Relaxations**:\n  - **Dynamical content**, computed as the negative derivative of autocorrelation vs. log-timescale\n\n#### Experiment Setup\n\n- **Data**:\n  - Use **pentapeptide MDGEN dataset**: 100k-frame, 10 ns trajectories.\n  - Apply **preprocessing** to preserve both fast and slow timescale dynamics.\n- **Model Training**:\n  - Train modified SiT with **non-causal Hyena operator** (O(N log N) complexity).\n  - Follow training setup: data splits, hyperparameters, and runtime settings as in **Tables 2 and 4**.\n- **Trajectory Generation**:\n  - From the trained model, generate a **single long trajectory** (e.g., 10 ns).\n- **Evaluation**:\n  1. Compute **torsional autocorrelation functions** over 100 fs \u2013 100 ps lag times.\n  2. Derive **dynamic content** curves to assess multi-timescale relaxation.\n  3. Compare results to a **ground-truth trajectory** generated via MD.",
      "expected_outcome": "The non-causal Hyena-augmented SiT model should generate extremely long trajectories whose autocorrelation curves match those from MD across all timescales and dynamical content curves capture both fast oscillatory and slow relaxation features.\n\nThis demonstrates that the model can span multiple dynamical regimes, enabling consistent and physically plausible molecular simulations over extended durations.",
