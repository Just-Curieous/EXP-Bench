Run the MDGEN forward simulation on the test tetrapeptides:\n   ```\n   python sim_inference.py --sim_ckpt forward_sim.ckpt --data_dir data/4AA_sims --split splits/4AA_test.csv --num_rollouts 10 --num_frames 1000 --xtc --out_dir results_mdgen\n   ```\n   This will generate 10 rollouts of 10 ns each (equivalent to 100 ns) for each test peptide using MDGEN, and the script will output the wall-clock time taken.\n\n3. Analyze the MDGEN simulation results to evaluate accuracy metrics:\n   ```\n   python -m scripts.analyze_peptide_sim --mddir data/4AA_sims --pdbdir results_mdgen --plot --save --num_workers 1\n   ```\n   This will compute the Jensen-Shannon Divergence (JSD) of torsion distributions, torsion angle relaxation times, and free energy surface comparisons via TICA.\n\n4.
