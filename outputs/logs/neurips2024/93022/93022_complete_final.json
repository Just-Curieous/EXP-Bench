      "agent_instructions": "Your task is to implement a system for generating and analyzing transition paths in molecular dynamics simulations. The system consists of two main components:\n\n1. A transition path generator that uses a pre-trained MDGEN model to create paths between conformational states of peptides.\n2. An analysis tool that evaluates the quality of these generated paths compared to reference molecular dynamics simulations.\n\nFor the transition path generator:\n- Load a pre-trained MDGEN model from a checkpoint\n- Process peptide data from specified directories\n- For each peptide, build a Markov State Model (MSM) from reference MD trajectories\n- Identify meaningful start and end states by analyzing the flux between metastable states\n- Generate transition paths between these states using the MDGEN model\n- Save the generated paths in appropriate molecular formats (PDB, XTC) with metadata\n\nFor the analysis tool:\n- Load the generated transition paths and reference MSM data\n- Calculate three key metrics to evaluate path quality:\n  a) Path Likelihood under the reference MSM\n  b) Fraction of Valid Paths\n  c) Jensen-Shannon Divergence (JSD) between visited state distributions\n- Compare the generated paths against MSMs built from replicate MD simulations of various durations (50ns, 30ns, 20ns, 10ns, 5ns, 2ns)\n- Visualize results with plots showing state distributions and transition paths\n- Save analysis results for further processing\n\nThe implementation should use PyEMMA for Markov modeling, MDTraj for trajectory manipulation, and appropriate visualization libraries for plotting results.",
