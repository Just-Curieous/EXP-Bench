            "method": "Design an experiment on the Hawk dataset (approximately 8,000 videos divided into a 90% training and 10% testing split). Train two versions of the model: one full model that incorporates all motion components (fm, Pm, and motion input Xm) and another ablated model where all explicit motion information is removed. Evaluate both models on two tasks: (a) anomaly video description generation and (b) anomaly video question-answering. Use four Text-Level metrics (BLEU-1, BLEU-2, BLEU-3, BLEU-4) to assess word overlap and GPT-guided metrics (Reasonability, Detail, Consistency) to quantitatively measure the quality of the outputs.",

The task requires implementing an ablation study, focusing on the conditional inclusion or exclusion of this motion-language matching loss, which is central to the paper's novel contribution. Among the detailed requirements, the core components involve modifying the model to include/exclude the motion-language matching loss and calculating the corresponding motion-specific and cosine similarity losses. These steps (Step 13: Calculate the motion-language matching loss, Step 14: Calculate the cosine similarity loss, Step 16: Check if motion loss should be disabled) are directly related to the novel framework introduced in the paper, hence classified as core. Other components, such as setting up distributed training, parsing command line arguments, initializing seeds, setting up logging, building datasets, processing video frames, combining features, and logging metrics, are non-core as they involve standard procedures in model training and evaluation, supporting the orchestration of the experiment without requiring implementation of the novel method itself."
