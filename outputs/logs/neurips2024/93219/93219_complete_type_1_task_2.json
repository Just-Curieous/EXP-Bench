      "question": "Does integrating a motion-language matching loss improve the correlation between motion cues and the generated language in anomaly descriptions, particularly when evaluated on the open-world video anomaly dataset (Hawk) provided with the repository?",
      "method": "Perform an ablation study on both anomaly video description generation and video question-answering tasks using the Hawk dataset. Train two variants of the model on the same anomaly video dataset: one including all components (with the motion-language matching loss) and one identical except for the removal of the motion-language matching loss term. For video description, split each video into dense clips, generate captions using automated perception tools, and then use a language model to create detailed anomaly-related descriptions. For video question-answering, assign open-form questions based on the generated descriptions and use a language model to produce corresponding answers. Evaluate both variants using text-level metrics (BLEU-1, BLEU-2, BLEU-3, BLEU-4) and natural language evaluation metrics (Reasonability, Detail, Consistency) to assess how the absence of the motion-language matching loss affects the alignment between motion features and the generated textual outputs.",
      "expected_outcome": "It is expected that excluding the motion-language matching loss will result in a notable drop in performance across both the video description and question-answering tasks, as evidenced by lower BLEU scores and reduced ratings in Reasonability, Detail, and Consistency. This outcome would confirm that the motion-language matching loss plays a critical role in ensuring that the generated language accurately reflects the motion anomalies observed in the videos.",

      "usage_instructions": "To perform the ablation study on the motion-language matching loss, you need to train two variants of the model using the provided scripts. First, train the full model with the motion-language matching loss by running 'NCCL_P2P_DISABLE=1 CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1,2,3 torchrun --nproc_per_node=4 --master_port='12001' train.py --cfg-path ./configs/train_configs/stage2_finetune.yaml'. Then, to train the variant without the motion-language matching loss, modify the stage2_finetune.yaml configuration file by adding 'disable_motion_loss: True' under the model section, and run the same training command. The model's forward method in hawk/models/video_llama.py shows that it calculates both a standard loss and a motion-specific loss ('loss_motion'), which is the motion-language matching loss component. After training both variants, evaluate them on the Hawk dataset using the same metrics (BLEU-1, BLEU-2, BLEU-3, BLEU-4, Reasonability, Detail, Consistency) to compare performance.",
