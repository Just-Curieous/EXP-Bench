    "usage_instructions": "To perform the ablation study on the motion-language matching loss, you need to train two variants of the model using the provided scripts. First, train the full model with the motion-language matching loss by running 'NCCL_P2P_DISABLE=1 CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1,2,3 torchrun --nproc_per_node=4 --master_port='12001' train.py --cfg-path ./configs/train_configs/stage2_finetune.yaml'. Then, to train the variant without the motion-language matching loss, modify the stage2_finetune.yaml configuration file by adding 'disable_motion_loss: True' under the model section, and run the same training command. The model's forward method in hawk/models/video_llama.py shows that it calculates both a standard loss and a motion-specific loss ('loss_motion'), which is the motion-language matching loss component. After training both variants, evaluate them on the Hawk dataset using the same metrics (BLEU-1, BLEU-2, BLEU-3, BLEU-4, Reasonability, Detail, Consistency) to compare performance."
