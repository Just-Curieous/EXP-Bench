      "question": "Does explicit motion information improve the accuracy of video anomaly description generation and question-answering when tested on the Hawk anomaly video dataset?",
      "method": "Design an experiment on the Hawk dataset (approximately 8,000 videos divided into a 90% training and 10% testing split). Train two versions of the model: one full model that incorporates all motion components (fm, Pm, and motion input Xm) and another ablated model where all explicit motion information is removed. Evaluate both models on two tasks: (a) anomaly video description generation and (b) anomaly video question-answering. Use four Text-Level metrics (BLEU-1, BLEU-2, BLEU-3, BLEU-4) to assess word overlap and GPT-guided metrics (Reasonability, Detail, Consistency) to quantitatively measure the quality of the outputs.",
