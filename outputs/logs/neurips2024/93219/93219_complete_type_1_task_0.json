      "question": "Does explicit motion information improve the accuracy of video anomaly description generation and question-answering when tested on the Hawk anomaly video dataset?",
      "method": "Design an experiment on the Hawk dataset (approximately 8,000 videos divided into a 90% training and 10% testing split). Train two versions of the model: one full model that incorporates all motion components (fm, Pm, and motion input Xm) and another ablated model where all explicit motion information is removed. Evaluate both models on two tasks: (a) anomaly video description generation and (b) anomaly video question-answering. Use four Text-Level metrics (BLEU-1, BLEU-2, BLEU-3, BLEU-4) to assess word overlap and GPT-guided metrics (Reasonability, Detail, Consistency) to quantitatively measure the quality of the outputs.",
      "expected_outcome": "The ablated model without explicit motion information should exhibit lower performance across all metrics compared to the full model. This supports the claim that incorporating explicit motion information enhances the model\u2019s ability to describe motion-related anomalies and improves overall anomaly understanding in both description generation and question-answering tasks.",

      "usage_instructions": "To evaluate the impact of explicit motion information on video anomaly description generation and question-answering on the Hawk dataset:\n\n1. First, train the full model with motion components using:\n   ```\n   NCCL_P2P_DISABLE=1 CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1,2,3 torchrun --nproc_per_node=4 --master_port='12001' train.py --cfg-path ./configs/train_configs/stage2_finetune.yaml\n   ```\n   This trains the complete model with all motion components (fm, Pm, and motion input Xm).\n\n2. Then, create a modified configuration file by copying stage2_finetune.yaml to stage2_finetune_no_motion.yaml and modify it to disable motion components by setting the motion-related parameters to False or removing them.\n\n3. Train the ablated model without motion components using:\n   ```\n   NCCL_P2P_DISABLE=1 CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1,2,3 torchrun --nproc_per_node=4 --master_port='12001' train.py --cfg-path ./configs/train_configs/stage2_finetune_no_motion.yaml\n   ```\n\n4. For evaluation on both tasks (anomaly video description generation and question-answering), use app.py with the appropriate model checkpoints:\n   ```\n   # For full model with motion\n   python app.py --cfg-path configs/eval_configs/eval.yaml --model_type llama_v2 --gpu-id 0\n   \n   # For ablated model without motion\n   python app.py --cfg-path configs/eval_configs/eval_no_motion.yaml --model_type llama_v2 --gpu-id 0\n   ```\n\n5.
