      "question": "Will the CycleNet model leveraging the RCF technique outperform existing state-of-the-art models iTransformer on ETTh1 & ETTh2 forecasting tasks?",
      "method": "1. **Problem Setup:** \n    - **Task:** \n    Compare the performance of CycleNet leveraging the RCF technique against the iTransformer model on time series forecasting tasks.\n    - **Objective:** \n    Determine whether the CycleNet model achieves better forecasting accuracy as measured by MSE and MAE on the ETTh1 & ETTh2 datasets.\n\n2. **Testing Dataset:** \n    - ETTh1 & ETTh2 (time series forecasting tasks)\n    - Preprocessing operations on the datasets, such as dataset splitting and normalization methods, remained consistent with prior works (e.g., Autoformer [Haixu Wu, Jiehui Xu, Jianmin Wang, and Mingsheng Long. Autoformer: Decomposition transformers with auto-correlation for long-term series forecasting. Advances in neural information processing systems, 34:22419\u201322430, 2021.], iTransformer [Yong Liu, Tengge Hu, Haoran Zhang, Haixu Wu, Shiyu Wang, Lintao Ma, and Mingsheng Long. itransformer: Inverted transformers are effective for time series forecasting. In The Twelfth International Conference on Learning Representations, 2024.], etc.).\n3. **Comparative Evaluation:**  \n    - Models:\n        - iTransformer (Baseline model)\n        - CycleNet (Proposed model with MLP and Linear backbones)\n\n4. **Training Detail:**\n    - Fixed look-back window (L=96)\n    - Forecast horizons (H \u2208 {96, 192, 336, 720})\n    - Use PyTorch and Adam optimizer for training\n    - Utilize an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 GPU for training\n\n5. **Normalization detail:**\n    - Normalization is a technique used to standardize the range of independent variables or features of data. In the context of time series, it addresses distributional shifts by removing varying statistical properties such as mean and standard deviation from the data. This helps to prevent models from performing poorly due to changes in the data distribution over time. The technique standardizes the input data within a window and later reverts it back to its original scale for predictions. In CycleNet, this is implemented outside of the input and output steps using instance normalization, inspired by methods like RevIN.\n\n    1. Normalize the input window \\( x_{t-L+1:t} \\):\n    \\[\n   x_{t-L+1:t} = \\frac{x_{t-L+1:t} - \\mu}{\\sqrt{\\sigma + \\epsilon}}\n   \\]\n   where \\(\\mu\\) is the mean of the input window, \\(\\sigma\\) is the standard deviation of the input window, and \\(\\epsilon\\) is a small constant for numerical stability.\n\n    2. Re-normalize the prediction \\( \\hat{x}_{t+1:t+H} \\):\n   \\[\n   \\hat{x}_{t+1:t+H} = \\hat{x}_{t+1:t+H} \\times \\sqrt{\\sigma + \\epsilon} + \\mu\n   \\]\n   Here, \\( \\hat{x}_{t+1:t+H} \\) is the model's predicted output, \\(\\mu\\) and \\(\\sigma\\) are the mean and standard deviation of the input window, and \\(\\epsilon\\) ensures numerical stability.\n\n\n6. **Loss Function:**\n    - CycleNet defaults to using Mean Squared Error (MSE) as the loss function to ensure fair comparison with other methods, formulated as:\n        - Loss = \\( \\| x_{t+1:t+H} - \\bar{x}_{t+1:t+H} \\|_2^2 \\)\n\n7. **Evaluation Metrics:**\n    - MSE (Mean Squared Error)\n    - MAE (Mean Absolute Error)\n\n8. **Experiment Detail:**\n- We utilized widely used benchmark datasets for LTSF tasks, including the ETT series, Electricity, Solar-Energy, Traffic, and Weather. Following prior works such as Autoformer and iTransformer, we split the ETTs dataset into training, validation, and test sets with a ratio of 6:2:2, while the other datasets were split in a ratio of 7:1:2. \n- We implemented CycleNet using PyTorch and conducted experiments on a single NVIDIA RTX 4090 GPU with 24GB of memory. CycleNet was trained for 30 epochs with early stopping based on a patience of 5 on the validation set. The batch size was set uniformly to 256 for ETTs and the Weather dataset, and 64 for the remaining datasets. This adjustment was made because the latter datasets have a larger number of channels, requiring a relatively smaller batch size to avoid out-of-memory issues. The learning rate was selected from the range {0.002, 0.005, 0.01} based on the performance on the validation set. The hyperparameter W was set consistently to the pre-inferred cycle length. Additionally, the hidden layer size of CycleNet/MLP was uniformly set to 512. By default, CycleNet uses RevIN without learnable affine parameters. However, we found that on the Solar dataset, using RevIN leads to a significant performance drop. The primary reason for this may be that photovoltaic power generation data contains continuous segments of zero values (no power generation at night). When the look-back windows are not an integer multiple of a day, the calculation of means in RevIN can be significantly affected, leading to decreased performance. Therefore, for this dataset, we did not apply the RevIN strategy.",

      "question": "How critical is the correct setting of the hyperparameter W (the learnable cycle length) in enabling RCF to effectively capture periodic patterns, particularly when W exactly matches the maximum cycle length as pre-inferred from the dataset?",
      "method": "1. **Problem Setup:** \n    - **Task:** \n    Investigate the effect of different settings of W on the performance of RCF in time-series forecasting.\n    - **Objective:** \n    Determine whether matching W to the pre-inferred maximum cycle length significantly enhances forecasting accuracy.\n\n2. **Testing Dataset:** \n    - Datasets:\n        - Electricity (Cycle length=168)\n        - Traffic (Cycle length=168)\n        - Solar-Energy (Cycle length=144)\n        - ETTm1 (Cycle length=96)\n        - ETTh1 (Cycle length=24)\n    - Preprocessing operations on the datasets, such as dataset splitting and normalization methods, remained consistent with prior works (e.g., Autoformer [Haixu Wu, Jiehui Xu, Jianmin Wang, and Mingsheng Long. Autoformer: Decomposition transformers with auto-correlation for long-term series forecasting. Advances in neural information processing systems, 34:22419\u201322430, 2021.], iTransformer [Yong Liu, Tengge Hu, Haoran Zhang, Haixu Wu, Shiyu Wang, Lintao Ma, and Mingsheng Long. itransformer: Inverted transformers are effective for time series forecasting. In The Twelfth International Conference on Learning Representations, 2024.], etc.).\n3. **Comparative Evaluation:**  \n    - Use the CycleNet/Linear model.\n\n    Vary the hyperparameter: W across multiple settings:\n        - W exactly matches the pre-inferred maximum cycle length\n        - W is higher than the correct cycle length.\n        - W is lower than the correct cycle length.\n    Baseline scenario: RCF module is disabled entirely.\n\n4. **Training Detail:**\n    - Fixed look-back window (L=96)\n    - Forecast horizons (H \u2208 {96, 192, 336, 720})\n    - Use PyTorch and Adam optimizer for training\n    - Utilize an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 GPU for training\n\n5. **Normalization detail:**\n    - Normalization is a technique used to standardize the range of independent variables or features of data. In the context of time series, it addresses distributional shifts by removing varying statistical properties such as mean and standard deviation from the data. This helps to prevent models from performing poorly due to changes in the data distribution over time. The technique standardizes the input data within a window and later reverts it back to its original scale for predictions. In CycleNet, this is implemented outside of the input and output steps using instance normalization, inspired by methods like RevIN.\n\n    1. Normalize the input window \\( x_{t-L+1:t} \\):\n    \\[\n   x_{t-L+1:t} = \\frac{x_{t-L+1:t} - \\mu}{\\sqrt{\\sigma + \\epsilon}}\n   \\]\n   where \\(\\mu\\) is the mean of the input window, \\(\\sigma\\) is the standard deviation of the input window, and \\(\\epsilon\\) is a small constant for numerical stability.\n\n    2. Re-normalize the prediction \\( \\hat{x}_{t+1:t+H} \\):\n   \\[\n   \\hat{x}_{t+1:t+H} = \\hat{x}_{t+1:t+H} \\times \\sqrt{\\sigma + \\epsilon} + \\mu\n   \\]\n   Here, \\( \\hat{x}_{t+1:t+H} \\) is the model's predicted output, \\(\\mu\\) and \\(\\sigma\\) are the mean and standard deviation of the input window, and \\(\\epsilon\\) ensures numerical stability.\n\n\n6. **Loss Function:**\n    - CycleNet defaults to using Mean Squared Error (MSE) as the loss function to ensure fair comparison with other methods, formulated as:\n        - Loss = \\( \\| x_{t+1:t+H} - \\bar{x}_{t+1:t+H} \\|_2^2 \\)\n\n7. **Evaluation Metrics:**\n    - MSE (Mean Squared Error)\n    - MAE (Mean Absolute Error)\n    - Compare forecasting performance across different settings of W\n\n8. **Experiment Detail:**\n- We utilized widely used benchmark datasets for LTSF tasks, including the ETT series, Electricity, Solar-Energy, Traffic, and Weather. Following prior works such as Autoformer and iTransformer, we split the ETTs dataset into training, validation, and test sets with a ratio of 6:2:2, while the other datasets were split in a ratio of 7:1:2. \n- We implemented CycleNet using PyTorch and conducted experiments on a single NVIDIA RTX 4090 GPU with 24GB of memory. CycleNet was trained for 30 epochs with early stopping based on a patience of 5 on the validation set. The batch size was set uniformly to 256 for ETTs and the Weather dataset, and 64 for the remaining datasets. This adjustment was made because the latter datasets have a larger number of channels, requiring a relatively smaller batch size to avoid out-of-memory issues. The learning rate was selected from the range {0.002, 0.005, 0.01} based on the performance on the validation set. The hyperparameter W was set consistently to the pre-inferred cycle length. Additionally, the hidden layer size of CycleNet/MLP was uniformly set to 512. By default, CycleNet uses RevIN without learnable affine parameters. However, we found that on the Solar dataset, using RevIN leads to a significant performance drop. The primary reason for this may be that photovoltaic power generation data contains continuous segments of zero values (no power generation at night). When the look-back windows are not an integer multiple of a day, the calculation of means in RevIN can be significantly affected, leading to decreased performance. Therefore, for this dataset, we did not apply the RevIN strategy.",
      "expected_outcome": "It is anticipated that when the hyperparameter W is correctly set to match the pre-inferred maximum cycle length , the model will demonstrate significantly improved performance (lower MSE and MAE) compared to settings where W is mis-specified or when the RCF module is disabled. This outcome will highlight the sensitivity of the model performance to the accurate setting of W and underscore its necessity for optimal periodic pattern learning.",

Autoformer: Decomposition transformers with auto-correlation for long-term series forecasting. Advances in neural information processing systems, 34:22419\u201322430, 2021.], iTransformer [Yong Liu, Tengge Hu, Haoran Zhang, Haixu Wu, Shiyu Wang, Lintao Ma, and Mingsheng Long. itransformer: Inverted transformers are effective for time series forecasting. In The Twelfth International Conference on Learning Representations, 2024.], etc.).\n3. **Comparative Evaluation:**  \n    - Models:\n        - CycleNet with MLP backbone (Proposed model)\n        - CycleNet with Linear backbone (Baseline model)\n\n4. **Training Detail:**\n    - Fixed look-back window (L=96)\n    - Forecast horizons (H \u2208 {96, 192, 336, 720})\n    - Use PyTorch and Adam optimizer for training\n    - Utilize an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 GPU for training\n\n5. **Normalization detail:**\n    - Normalization is a technique used to standardize the range of independent variables or features of data. In the context of time series, it addresses distributional shifts by removing varying statistical properties such as mean and standard deviation from the data. This helps to prevent models from performing poorly due to changes in the data distribution over time. The technique standardizes the input data within a window and later reverts it back to its original scale for predictions. In CycleNet, this is implemented outside of the input and output steps using instance normalization, inspired by methods like RevIN.\n\n    1. Normalize the input window \\( x_{t-L+1:t} \\):\n    \\[\n   x_{t-L+1:t} = \\frac{x_{t-L+1:t} - \\mu}{\\sqrt{\\sigma + \\epsilon}}\n   \\]\n   where \\(\\mu\\) is the mean of the input window, \\(\\sigma\\) is the standard deviation of the input window, and \\(\\epsilon\\) is a small constant for numerical stability.\n\n    2. Re-normalize the prediction \\( \\hat{x}_{t+1:t+H} \\):\n   \\[\n   \\hat{x}_{t+1:t+H} = \\hat{x}_{t+1:t+H} \\times \\sqrt{\\sigma + \\epsilon} + \\mu\n   \\]\n   Here, \\( \\hat{x}_{t+1:t+H} \\) is the model's predicted output, \\(\\mu\\) and \\(\\sigma\\) are the mean and standard deviation of the input window, and \\(\\epsilon\\) ensures numerical stability.\n\n\n6. **Loss Function:**\n    - CycleNet defaults to using Mean Squared Error (MSE) as the loss function to ensure fair comparison with other methods, formulated as:\n        - Loss = \\( \\| x_{t+1:t+H} - \\bar{x}_{t+1:t+H} \\|_2^2 \\)\n\n7. **Evaluation Metrics:**\n    - MSE (Mean Squared Error)\n    - MAE (Mean Absolute Error)\n\n\n8. **Experiment Detail:**\n- We utilized widely used benchmark datasets for LTSF tasks, including the ETT series, Electricity, Solar-Energy, Traffic, and Weather. Following prior works such as Autoformer and iTransformer, we split the ETTs dataset into training, validation, and test sets with a ratio of 6:2:2, while the other datasets were split in a ratio of 7:1:2. \n- We implemented CycleNet using PyTorch and conducted experiments on a single NVIDIA RTX 4090 GPU with 24GB of memory. CycleNet was trained for 30 epochs with early stopping based on a patience of 5 on the validation set. The batch size was set uniformly to 256 for ETTs and the Weather dataset, and 64 for the remaining datasets. This adjustment was made because the latter datasets have a larger number of channels, requiring a relatively smaller batch size to avoid out-of-memory issues. The learning rate was selected from the range {0.002, 0.005, 0.01} based on the performance on the validation set. The hyperparameter W was set consistently to the pre-inferred cycle length. Additionally, the hidden layer size of CycleNet/MLP was uniformly set to 512. By default, CycleNet uses RevIN without learnable affine parameters. However, we found that on the Solar dataset, using RevIN leads to a significant performance drop. The primary reason for this may be that photovoltaic power generation data contains continuous segments of zero values (no power generation at night). When the look-back windows are not an integer multiple of a day, the calculation of means in RevIN can be significantly affected, leading to decreased performance. Therefore, for this dataset, we did not apply the RevIN strategy.",

Normalize the input window \\( x_{t-L+1:t} \\):\n    \\[\n   x_{t-L+1:t} = \\frac{x_{t-L+1:t} - \\mu}{\\sqrt{\\sigma + \\epsilon}}\n   \\]\n   where \\(\\mu\\) is the mean of the input window, \\(\\sigma\\) is the standard deviation of the input window, and \\(\\epsilon\\) is a small constant for numerical stability.\n\n    2. Re-normalize the prediction \\( \\hat{x}_{t+1:t+H} \\):\n   \\[\n   \\hat{x}_{t+1:t+H} = \\hat{x}_{t+1:t+H} \\times \\sqrt{\\sigma + \\epsilon} + \\mu\n   \\]\n   Here, \\( \\hat{x}_{t+1:t+H} \\) is the model's predicted output, \\(\\mu\\) and \\(\\sigma\\) are the mean and standard deviation of the input window, and \\(\\epsilon\\) ensures numerical stability.\n\n\n6. **Loss Function:**\n    - CycleNet defaults to using Mean Squared Error (MSE) as the loss function to ensure fair comparison with other methods, formulated as:\n        - Loss = \\( \\| x_{t+1:t+H} - \\bar{x}_{t+1:t+H} \\|_2^2 \\)\n\n7. **Evaluation Metrics:**\n    - MSE (Mean Squared Error)\n    - MAE (Mean Absolute Error)\n\n8. **Experiment Detail:**\n- We utilized widely used benchmark datasets for LTSF tasks, including the ETT series, Electricity, Solar-Energy, Traffic, and Weather. Following prior works such as Autoformer and iTransformer, we split the ETTs dataset into training, validation, and test sets with a ratio of 6:2:2, while the other datasets were split in a ratio of 7:1:2. \n- We implemented CycleNet using PyTorch and conducted experiments on a single NVIDIA RTX 4090 GPU with 24GB of memory. CycleNet was trained for 30 epochs with early stopping based on a patience of 5 on the validation set. The batch size was set uniformly to 256 for ETTs and the Weather dataset, and 64 for the remaining datasets. This adjustment was made because the latter datasets have a larger number of channels, requiring a relatively smaller batch size to avoid out-of-memory issues. The learning rate was selected from the range {0.002, 0.005, 0.01} based on the performance on the validation set. The hyperparameter W was set consistently to the pre-inferred cycle length. Additionally, the hidden layer size of CycleNet/MLP was uniformly set to 512. By default, CycleNet uses RevIN without learnable affine parameters. However, we found that on the Solar dataset, using RevIN leads to a significant performance drop. The primary reason for this may be that photovoltaic power generation data contains continuous segments of zero values (no power generation at night). When the look-back windows are not an integer multiple of a day, the calculation of means in RevIN can be significantly affected, leading to decreased performance. Therefore, for this dataset, we did not apply the RevIN strategy.",

Following prior works such as Autoformer and iTransformer, we split the ETTs dataset into training, validation, and test sets with a ratio of 6:2:2, while the other datasets were split in a ratio of 7:1:2. \n- We implemented CycleNet using PyTorch and conducted experiments on a single NVIDIA RTX 4090 GPU with 24GB of memory. CycleNet was trained for 30 epochs with early stopping based on a patience of 5 on the validation set. The batch size was set uniformly to 256 for ETTs and the Weather dataset, and 64 for the remaining datasets. This adjustment was made because the latter datasets have a larger number of channels, requiring a relatively smaller batch size to avoid out-of-memory issues. The learning rate was selected from the range {0.002, 0.005, 0.01} based on the performance on the validation set. The hyperparameter W was set consistently to the pre-inferred cycle length. Additionally, the hidden layer size of CycleNet/MLP was uniformly set to 512. By default, CycleNet uses RevIN without learnable affine parameters. However, we found that on the Solar dataset, using RevIN leads to a significant performance drop. The primary reason for this may be that photovoltaic power generation data contains continuous segments of zero values (no power generation at night). When the look-back windows are not an integer multiple of a day, the calculation of means in RevIN can be significantly affected, leading to decreased performance. Therefore, for this dataset, we did not apply the RevIN strategy.",

      "question": "Does the integration of the RCF technique enhance the prediction accuracy of existing models, DLinear, PatchTST, and iTransformer, compared to using the same models without RCF?",
      "method": "1. **Problem Setup:** \n    - **Task:** \n    Assess whether adding the RCF technique improves the forecasting accuracy of widely used models.\n    - **Objective:** \n    Quantify the performance improvement in existing models when integrating RCF.\n\n2. **Testing Dataset:** \n    - Electricity dataset (time series forecasting tasks)\n    - Preprocessing operations on the datasets, such as dataset splitting and normalization methods, remained consistent with prior works (e.g., Autoformer [Haixu Wu, Jiehui Xu, Jianmin Wang, and Mingsheng Long. Autoformer: Decomposition transformers with auto-correlation for long-term series forecasting. Advances in neural information processing systems, 34:22419\u201322430, 2021.], iTransformer [Yong Liu, Tengge Hu, Haoran Zhang, Haixu Wu, Shiyu Wang, Lintao Ma, and Mingsheng Long. itransformer: Inverted transformers are effective for time series forecasting. In The Twelfth International Conference on Learning Representations, 2024.], etc.).\n3. **Comparative Evaluation:**  \n    - Models:\n        - DLinear + RCF vs. DLinear (without RCF)\n        - PatchTST + RCF vs. PatchTST (without RCF)\n        - iTransformer + RCF vs. iTransformer (without RCF)\n\n4. **Training Detail:**\n    - Fixed look-back window (L=96)\n    - Forecast horizons (H \u2208 {96, 192, 336, 720})\n    - Use PyTorch and Adam optimizer for training\n    - Utilize an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 GPU for training\n\n5. **Normalization detail:**\n    - Normalization is a technique used to standardize the range of independent variables or features of data. In the context of time series, it addresses distributional shifts by removing varying statistical properties such as mean and standard deviation from the data. This helps to prevent models from performing poorly due to changes in the data distribution over time. The technique standardizes the input data within a window and later reverts it back to its original scale for predictions. In CycleNet, this is implemented outside of the input and output steps using instance normalization, inspired by methods like RevIN.\n\n    1. Normalize the input window \\( x_{t-L+1:t} \\):\n    \\[\n   x_{t-L+1:t} = \\frac{x_{t-L+1:t} - \\mu}{\\sqrt{\\sigma + \\epsilon}}\n   \\]\n   where \\(\\mu\\) is the mean of the input window, \\(\\sigma\\) is the standard deviation of the input window, and \\(\\epsilon\\) is a small constant for numerical stability.\n\n    2. Re-normalize the prediction \\( \\hat{x}_{t+1:t+H} \\):\n   \\[\n   \\hat{x}_{t+1:t+H} = \\hat{x}_{t+1:t+H} \\times \\sqrt{\\sigma + \\epsilon} + \\mu\n   \\]\n   Here, \\( \\hat{x}_{t+1:t+H} \\) is the model's predicted output, \\(\\mu\\) and \\(\\sigma\\) are the mean and standard deviation of the input window, and \\(\\epsilon\\) ensures numerical stability.\n\n\n6. **Loss Function:**\n    - CycleNet defaults to using Mean Squared Error (MSE) as the loss function to ensure fair comparison with other methods, formulated as:\n        - Loss = \\( \\| x_{t+1:t+H} - \\bar{x}_{t+1:t+H} \\|_2^2 \\)\n\n7. **Evaluation Metrics:**\n    - MSE (Mean Squared Error)\n    - MAE (Mean Absolute Error)\n    - report base on score per horizon\n\n8. **Experiment Detail:**\n- We utilized widely used benchmark datasets for LTSF tasks, including the ETT series, Electricity, Solar-Energy, Traffic, and Weather. Following prior works such as Autoformer and iTransformer, we split the ETTs dataset into training, validation, and test sets with a ratio of 6:2:2, while the other datasets were split in a ratio of 7:1:2. \n- We implemented CycleNet using PyTorch and conducted experiments on a single NVIDIA RTX 4090 GPU with 24GB of memory. CycleNet was trained for 30 epochs with early stopping based on a patience of 5 on the validation set. The batch size was set uniformly to 256 for ETTs and the Weather dataset, and 64 for the remaining datasets. This adjustment was made because the latter datasets have a larger number of channels, requiring a relatively smaller batch size to avoid out-of-memory issues. The learning rate was selected from the range {0.002, 0.005, 0.01} based on the performance on the validation set. The hyperparameter W was set consistently to the pre-inferred cycle length. Additionally, the hidden layer size of CycleNet/MLP was uniformly set to 512. By default, CycleNet uses RevIN without learnable affine parameters. However, we found that on the Solar dataset, using RevIN leads to a significant performance drop. The primary reason for this may be that photovoltaic power generation data contains continuous segments of zero values (no power generation at night). When the look-back windows are not an integer multiple of a day, the calculation of means in RevIN can be significantly affected, leading to decreased performance. Therefore, for this dataset, we did not apply the RevIN strategy.",
      "expected_outcome": "It is observed that incorporating RCF still improves the performance of existing complex designed, deep stacked models (approximately 5% to 10%), such as PatchTST and iTransformer. Even for DLinear, which already employs the classical MOV-based STD technique, RCF was able to provide an improvement of approximately 20%. This further indicates the effectiveness and portability of RCF.",

      "method": "1. **Problem Setup:** \n    - **Task:** \n    Compare the effectiveness of RCF-based and Sparse-based trend estimation techniques in time-series forecasting.\n    - **Objective:** \n    Determine whether RCF provides superior forecasting accuracy compared to Sparse when applied to Electricity forecasting.\n\n2. **Testing Dataset:** \n    - Electricity (time series forecasting tasks)\n    - Preprocessing operations on the datasets, such as dataset splitting and normalization methods, remained consistent with prior works (e.g., Autoformer [Haixu Wu, Jiehui Xu, Jianmin Wang, and Mingsheng Long. Autoformer: Decomposition transformers with auto-correlation for long-term series forecasting. Advances in neural information processing systems, 34:22419\u201322430, 2021.], iTransformer [Yong Liu, Tengge Hu, Haoran Zhang, Haixu Wu, Shiyu Wang, Lintao Ma, and Mingsheng Long. itransformer: Inverted transformers are effective for time series forecasting. In The Twelfth International Conference on Learning Representations, 2024.], etc.).\n3. **Comparative Evaluation:**  \n    - Models:\n        - CLinear (RCF + Linear)\n        - SLinear (Sparse + Linear)\n    - Ensure no normalization is applied to isolate the effect of the STD method.\n\n4. **Training Detail:**\n    - Fixed look-back window (L=96)\n    - Forecast horizons (H \u2208 {96, 192, 336, 720})\n    - Use PyTorch and Adam optimizer for training\n    - Utilize an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 GPU for training\n\n5. **Normalization detail:**\n    - no additional instance normalization\n\n6. **Loss Function:**\n    - CycleNet defaults to using Mean Squared Error (MSE) as the loss function to ensure fair comparison with other methods, formulated as:\n        - Loss = \\( \\| x_{t+1:t+H} - \\bar{x}_{t+1:t+H} \\|_2^2 \\)\n\n7. **Evaluation Metrics:**\n    - MSE (Mean Squared Error)\n    - MAE (Mean Absolute Error)\n    - Compute the average performance across all forecast horizons.\n\n8. **Experiment Detail:**\n- We utilized widely used benchmark datasets for LTSF tasks, including the ETT series, Electricity, Solar-Energy, Traffic, and Weather. Following prior works such as Autoformer and iTransformer, we split the ETTs dataset into training, validation, and test sets with a ratio of 6:2:2, while the other datasets were split in a ratio of 7:1:2. \n- We implemented CycleNet using PyTorch and conducted experiments on a single NVIDIA RTX 4090 GPU with 24GB of memory. CycleNet was trained for 30 epochs with early stopping based on a patience of 5 on the validation set. The batch size was set uniformly to 256 for ETTs and the Weather dataset, and 64 for the remaining datasets. This adjustment was made because the latter datasets have a larger number of channels, requiring a relatively smaller batch size to avoid out-of-memory issues. The learning rate was selected from the range {0.002, 0.005, 0.01} based on the performance on the validation set. The hyperparameter W was set consistently to the pre-inferred cycle length. Additionally, the hidden layer size of CycleNet/MLP was uniformly set to 512. By default, CycleNet uses RevIN without learnable affine parameters. However, we found that on the Solar dataset, using RevIN leads to a significant performance drop. The primary reason for this may be that photovoltaic power generation data contains continuous segments of zero values (no power generation at night). When the look-back windows are not an integer multiple of a day, the calculation of means in RevIN can be significantly affected, leading to decreased performance. Therefore, for this dataset, we did not apply the RevIN strategy.\n\n9. **Addtional Note:**\nTo directly compare the effects of STD, the configuration used here is consistent with that of DLinear, with a sufficient look-back window length of 336 and no additional instance normalization strategies. Thus, CLinear here refers to CycleNet/Linear without RevIN.",
