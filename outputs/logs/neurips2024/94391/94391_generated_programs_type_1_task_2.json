    "no_answer": "After thoroughly exploring the repository, I could not find a specific script or set of scripts that directly answers the experiment question about how critical the correct setting of hyperparameter W is in enabling RCF to capture periodic patterns. While the repository contains scripts for running CycleNet with different cycle lengths (W) for different datasets (e.g., W=24 for ETTh1, W=96 for ETTm1, W=168 for Electricity), there are no scripts that systematically vary W within the same dataset to test values higher or lower than the pre-inferred maximum cycle length, nor is there a script that explicitly disables the RCF module for baseline comparison. The repository contains the necessary components to conduct such an experiment (the CycleNet model with configurable cycle length and Linear model for baseline), but would require creating new scripts that specifically vary W and compare performance across these variations."
