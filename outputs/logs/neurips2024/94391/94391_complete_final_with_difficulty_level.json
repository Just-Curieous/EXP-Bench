            "question": "Will the CycleNet model leveraging the RCF technique outperform existing state-of-the-art models iTransformer on ETTh1 & ETTh2 forecasting tasks?",
            "method": "1. **Problem Setup:** \n    - **Task:** \n    Compare the performance of CycleNet leveraging the RCF technique against the iTransformer model on time series forecasting tasks.\n    - **Objective:** \n    Determine whether the CycleNet model achieves better forecasting accuracy as measured by MSE and MAE on the ETTh1 & ETTh2 datasets.\n\n2. **Testing Dataset:** \n    - ETTh1 & ETTh2 (time series forecasting tasks)\n    - Preprocessing operations on the datasets, such as dataset splitting and normalization methods, remained consistent with prior works (e.g., Autoformer [Haixu Wu, Jiehui Xu, Jianmin Wang, and Mingsheng Long. Autoformer: Decomposition transformers with auto-correlation for long-term series forecasting. Advances in neural information processing systems, 34:22419\u201322430, 2021.], iTransformer [Yong Liu, Tengge Hu, Haoran Zhang, Haixu Wu, Shiyu Wang, Lintao Ma, and Mingsheng Long. itransformer: Inverted transformers are effective for time series forecasting. In The Twelfth International Conference on Learning Representations, 2024.], etc.).\n3. **Comparative Evaluation:**  \n    - Models:\n        - iTransformer (Baseline model)\n        - CycleNet (Proposed model with MLP and Linear backbones)\n\n4. **Training Detail:**\n    - Fixed look-back window (L=96)\n    - Forecast horizons (H \u2208 {96, 192, 336, 720})\n    - Use PyTorch and Adam optimizer for training\n    - Utilize an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 GPU for training\n\n5. **Normalization detail:**\n    - Normalization is a technique used to standardize the range of independent variables or features of data. In the context of time series, it addresses distributional shifts by removing varying statistical properties such as mean and standard deviation from the data. This helps to prevent models from performing poorly due to changes in the data distribution over time. The technique standardizes the input data within a window and later reverts it back to its original scale for predictions. In CycleNet, this is implemented outside of the input and output steps using instance normalization, inspired by methods like RevIN.\n\n    1. Normalize the input window \\( x_{t-L+1:t} \\):\n    \\[\n   x_{t-L+1:t} = \\frac{x_{t-L+1:t} - \\mu}{\\sqrt{\\sigma + \\epsilon}}\n   \\]\n   where \\(\\mu\\) is the mean of the input window, \\(\\sigma\\) is the standard deviation of the input window, and \\(\\epsilon\\) is a small constant for numerical stability.\n\n    2. Re-normalize the prediction \\( \\hat{x}_{t+1:t+H} \\):\n   \\[\n   \\hat{x}_{t+1:t+H} = \\hat{x}_{t+1:t+H} \\times \\sqrt{\\sigma + \\epsilon} + \\mu\n   \\]\n   Here, \\( \\hat{x}_{t+1:t+H} \\) is the model's predicted output, \\(\\mu\\) and \\(\\sigma\\) are the mean and standard deviation of the input window, and \\(\\epsilon\\) ensures numerical stability.\n\n\n6. **Loss Function:**\n    - CycleNet defaults to using Mean Squared Error (MSE) as the loss function to ensure fair comparison with other methods, formulated as:\n        - Loss = \\( \\| x_{t+1:t+H} - \\bar{x}_{t+1:t+H} \\|_2^2 \\)\n\n7. **Evaluation Metrics:**\n    - MSE (Mean Squared Error)\n    - MAE (Mean Absolute Error)\n\n8. **Experiment Detail:**\n- We utilized widely used benchmark datasets for LTSF tasks, including the ETT series, Electricity, Solar-Energy, Traffic, and Weather. Following prior works such as Autoformer and iTransformer, we split the ETTs dataset into training, validation, and test sets with a ratio of 6:2:2, while the other datasets were split in a ratio of 7:1:2. \n- We implemented CycleNet using PyTorch and conducted experiments on a single NVIDIA RTX 4090 GPU with 24GB of memory. CycleNet was trained for 30 epochs with early stopping based on a patience of 5 on the validation set. The batch size was set uniformly to 256 for ETTs and the Weather dataset, and 64 for the remaining datasets. This adjustment was made because the latter datasets have a larger number of channels, requiring a relatively smaller batch size to avoid out-of-memory issues. The learning rate was selected from the range {0.002, 0.005, 0.01} based on the performance on the validation set. The hyperparameter W was set consistently to the pre-inferred cycle length. Additionally, the hidden layer size of CycleNet/MLP was uniformly set to 512. By default, CycleNet uses RevIN without learnable affine parameters. However, we found that on the Solar dataset, using RevIN leads to a significant performance drop. The primary reason for this may be that photovoltaic power generation data contains continuous segments of zero values (no power generation at night). When the look-back windows are not an integer multiple of a day, the calculation of means in RevIN can be significantly affected, leading to decreased performance. Therefore, for this dataset, we did not apply the RevIN strategy.",

Specifically, Steps 4 and 5 for CycleNet and Steps 6 and 7 for LDLinear involve writing new logic for the model architecture, which are core components. The non-core components are related to the setup, training, and evaluation of these models (Steps 1, 2, 3, 8, and 9), which are typical orchestration tasks that do not require implementing the novel algorithm itself.

            "question": "How critical is the correct setting of the hyperparameter W (the learnable cycle length) in enabling RCF to effectively capture periodic patterns, particularly when W exactly matches the maximum cycle length as pre-inferred from the dataset?",
            "method": "1. **Problem Setup:** \n    - **Task:** \n    Investigate the effect of different settings of W on the performance of RCF in time-series forecasting.\n    - **Objective:** \n    Determine whether matching W to the pre-inferred maximum cycle length significantly enhances forecasting accuracy.\n\n2. **Testing Dataset:** \n    - Datasets:\n        - Electricity (Cycle length=168)\n        - Traffic (Cycle length=168)\n        - Solar-Energy (Cycle length=144)\n        - ETTm1 (Cycle length=96)\n        - ETTh1 (Cycle length=24)\n    - Preprocessing operations on the datasets, such as dataset splitting and normalization methods, remained consistent with prior works (e.g., Autoformer [Haixu Wu, Jiehui Xu, Jianmin Wang, and Mingsheng Long. Autoformer: Decomposition transformers with auto-correlation for long-term series forecasting. Advances in neural information processing systems, 34:22419\u201322430, 2021.], iTransformer [Yong Liu, Tengge Hu, Haoran Zhang, Haixu Wu, Shiyu Wang, Lintao Ma, and Mingsheng Long. itransformer: Inverted transformers are effective for time series forecasting. In The Twelfth International Conference on Learning Representations, 2024.], etc.).\n3. **Comparative Evaluation:**  \n    - Use the CycleNet/Linear model.\n\n    Vary the hyperparameter: W across multiple settings:\n        - W exactly matches the pre-inferred maximum cycle length\n        - W is higher than the correct cycle length.\n        - W is lower than the correct cycle length.\n    Baseline scenario: RCF module is disabled entirely.\n\n4. **Training Detail:**\n    - Fixed look-back window (L=96)\n    - Forecast horizons (H \u2208 {96, 192, 336, 720})\n    - Use PyTorch and Adam optimizer for training\n    - Utilize an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 GPU for training\n\n5. **Normalization detail:**\n    - Normalization is a technique used to standardize the range of independent variables or features of data. In the context of time series, it addresses distributional shifts by removing varying statistical properties such as mean and standard deviation from the data. This helps to prevent models from performing poorly due to changes in the data distribution over time. The technique standardizes the input data within a window and later reverts it back to its original scale for predictions. In CycleNet, this is implemented outside of the input and output steps using instance normalization, inspired by methods like RevIN.\n\n    1. Normalize the input window \\( x_{t-L+1:t} \\):\n    \\[\n   x_{t-L+1:t} = \\frac{x_{t-L+1:t} - \\mu}{\\sqrt{\\sigma + \\epsilon}}\n   \\]\n   where \\(\\mu\\) is the mean of the input window, \\(\\sigma\\) is the standard deviation of the input window, and \\(\\epsilon\\) is a small constant for numerical stability.\n\n    2. Re-normalize the prediction \\( \\hat{x}_{t+1:t+H} \\):\n   \\[\n   \\hat{x}_{t+1:t+H} = \\hat{x}_{t+1:t+H} \\times \\sqrt{\\sigma + \\epsilon} + \\mu\n   \\]\n   Here, \\( \\hat{x}_{t+1:t+H} \\) is the model's predicted output, \\(\\mu\\) and \\(\\sigma\\) are the mean and standard deviation of the input window, and \\(\\epsilon\\) ensures numerical stability.\n\n\n6. **Loss Function:**\n    - CycleNet defaults to using Mean Squared Error (MSE) as the loss function to ensure fair comparison with other methods, formulated as:\n        - Loss = \\( \\| x_{t+1:t+H} - \\bar{x}_{t+1:t+H} \\|_2^2 \\)\n\n7. **Evaluation Metrics:**\n    - MSE (Mean Squared Error)\n    - MAE (Mean Absolute Error)\n    - Compare forecasting performance across different settings of W\n\n8. **Experiment Detail:**\n- We utilized widely used benchmark datasets for LTSF tasks, including the ETT series, Electricity, Solar-Energy, Traffic, and Weather. Following prior works such as Autoformer and iTransformer, we split the ETTs dataset into training, validation, and test sets with a ratio of 6:2:2, while the other datasets were split in a ratio of 7:1:2. \n- We implemented CycleNet using PyTorch and conducted experiments on a single NVIDIA RTX 4090 GPU with 24GB of memory. CycleNet was trained for 30 epochs with early stopping based on a patience of 5 on the validation set. The batch size was set uniformly to 256 for ETTs and the Weather dataset, and 64 for the remaining datasets. This adjustment was made because the latter datasets have a larger number of channels, requiring a relatively smaller batch size to avoid out-of-memory issues. The learning rate was selected from the range {0.002, 0.005, 0.01} based on the performance on the validation set. The hyperparameter W was set consistently to the pre-inferred cycle length. Additionally, the hidden layer size of CycleNet/MLP was uniformly set to 512. By default, CycleNet uses RevIN without learnable affine parameters. However, we found that on the Solar dataset, using RevIN leads to a significant performance drop. The primary reason for this may be that photovoltaic power generation data contains continuous segments of zero values (no power generation at night). When the look-back windows are not an integer multiple of a day, the calculation of means in RevIN can be significantly affected, leading to decreased performance. Therefore, for this dataset, we did not apply the RevIN strategy.",
            "expected_outcome": "It is anticipated that when the hyperparameter W is correctly set to match the pre-inferred maximum cycle length , the model will demonstrate significantly improved performance (lower MSE and MAE) compared to settings where W is mis-specified or when the RCF module is disabled. This outcome will highlight the sensitivity of the model performance to the accurate setting of W and underscore its necessity for optimal periodic pattern learning.",

            "method": "1. **Problem Setup:** \n    - **Task:** \n    Compare the performance of CycleNet leveraging the RCF technique against the Crossformer model on electricity forecasting tasks.\n    - **Objective:** \n    Determine whether CycleNet achieves better forecasting accuracy as measured by MSE and MAE on the Electricity dataset.\n\n2. **Testing Dataset:** \n    - Electricity (time series forecasting task)\n    - Preprocessing operations on the datasets, such as dataset splitting and normalization methods, remained consistent with prior works (e.g., Autoformer [Haixu Wu, Jiehui Xu, Jianmin Wang, and Mingsheng Long. Autoformer: Decomposition transformers with auto-correlation for long-term series forecasting. Advances in neural information processing systems, 34:22419\u201322430, 2021.], iTransformer [Yong Liu, Tengge Hu, Haoran Zhang, Haixu Wu, Shiyu Wang, Lintao Ma, and Mingsheng Long. itransformer: Inverted transformers are effective for time series forecasting. In The Twelfth International Conference on Learning Representations, 2024.], etc.).\n3. **Comparative Evaluation:**  \n    - Models:\n        - Crossformer (Baseline model)\n        - CycleNet (Proposed model with MLP and Linear backbones)\n\n4. **Training Detail:**\n    - Fixed look-back window (L=96)\n    - Forecast horizons (H \u2208 {96, 192, 336, 720})\n    - Use PyTorch and Adam optimizer for training\n    - Utilize an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 GPU for training\n\n5. **Normalization detail:**\n    - Normalization is a technique used to standardize the range of independent variables or features of data. In the context of time series, it addresses distributional shifts by removing varying statistical properties such as mean and standard deviation from the data. This helps to prevent models from performing poorly due to changes in the data distribution over time. The technique standardizes the input data within a window and later reverts it back to its original scale for predictions. In CycleNet, this is implemented outside of the input and output steps using instance normalization, inspired by methods like RevIN.\n\n    1. Normalize the input window \\( x_{t-L+1:t} \\):\n    \\[\n   x_{t-L+1:t} = \\frac{x_{t-L+1:t} - \\mu}{\\sqrt{\\sigma + \\epsilon}}\n   \\]\n   where \\(\\mu\\) is the mean of the input window, \\(\\sigma\\) is the standard deviation of the input window, and \\(\\epsilon\\) is a small constant for numerical stability.\n\n    2. Re-normalize the prediction \\( \\hat{x}_{t+1:t+H} \\):\n   \\[\n   \\hat{x}_{t+1:t+H} = \\hat{x}_{t+1:t+H} \\times \\sqrt{\\sigma + \\epsilon} + \\mu\n   \\]\n   Here, \\( \\hat{x}_{t+1:t+H} \\) is the model's predicted output, \\(\\mu\\) and \\(\\sigma\\) are the mean and standard deviation of the input window, and \\(\\epsilon\\) ensures numerical stability.\n\n\n6. **Loss Function:**\n    - CycleNet defaults to using Mean Squared Error (MSE) as the loss function to ensure fair comparison with other methods, formulated as:\n        - Loss = \\( \\| x_{t+1:t+H} - \\bar{x}_{t+1:t+H} \\|_2^2 \\)\n\n7. **Evaluation Metrics:**\n    - MSE (Mean Squared Error)\n    - MAE (Mean Absolute Error)\n\n8. **Experiment Detail:**\n- We utilized widely used benchmark datasets for LTSF tasks, including the ETT series, Electricity, Solar-Energy, Traffic, and Weather. Following prior works such as Autoformer and iTransformer, we split the ETTs dataset into training, validation, and test sets with a ratio of 6:2:2, while the other datasets were split in a ratio of 7:1:2. \n- We implemented CycleNet using PyTorch and conducted experiments on a single NVIDIA RTX 4090 GPU with 24GB of memory. CycleNet was trained for 30 epochs with early stopping based on a patience of 5 on the validation set. The batch size was set uniformly to 256 for ETTs and the Weather dataset, and 64 for the remaining datasets. This adjustment was made because the latter datasets have a larger number of channels, requiring a relatively smaller batch size to avoid out-of-memory issues. The learning rate was selected from the range {0.002, 0.005, 0.01} based on the performance on the validation set. The hyperparameter W was set consistently to the pre-inferred cycle length. Additionally, the hidden layer size of CycleNet/MLP was uniformly set to 512. By default, CycleNet uses RevIN without learnable affine parameters. However, we found that on the Solar dataset, using RevIN leads to a significant performance drop. The primary reason for this may be that photovoltaic power generation data contains continuous segments of zero values (no power generation at night). When the look-back windows are not an integer multiple of a day, the calculation of means in RevIN can be significantly affected, leading to decreased performance. Therefore, for this dataset, we did not apply the RevIN strategy.",

            "question": "Does CycleNet/MLP model perform better than CycleNet/Linear on the Solar-Energy forecasting task?",
            "method": "1. **Problem Setup:** \n    - **Task:** \n    Compare the performance of CycleNet with MLP and Linear backbones on the Solar-Energy forecasting task.\n    - **Objective:** \n    Determine whether CycleNet/MLP performs better than CycleNet/Linear in terms of forecasting accuracy on the Solar-Energy dataset.\n\n2. **Testing Dataset:** \n    - Solar-Energy (time series forecasting task)\n    - Preprocessing operations on the datasets, such as dataset splitting and normalization methods, remained consistent with prior works (e.g., Autoformer [Haixu Wu, Jiehui Xu, Jianmin Wang, and Mingsheng Long. Autoformer: Decomposition transformers with auto-correlation for long-term series forecasting. Advances in neural information processing systems, 34:22419\u201322430, 2021.], iTransformer [Yong Liu, Tengge Hu, Haoran Zhang, Haixu Wu, Shiyu Wang, Lintao Ma, and Mingsheng Long. itransformer: Inverted transformers are effective for time series forecasting. In The Twelfth International Conference on Learning Representations, 2024.], etc.).\n3. **Comparative Evaluation:**  \n    - Models:\n        - CycleNet with MLP backbone (Proposed model)\n        - CycleNet with Linear backbone (Baseline model)\n\n4. **Training Detail:**\n    - Fixed look-back window (L=96)\n    - Forecast horizons (H \u2208 {96, 192, 336, 720})\n    - Use PyTorch and Adam optimizer for training\n    - Utilize an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 GPU for training\n\n5. **Normalization detail:**\n    - Normalization is a technique used to standardize the range of independent variables or features of data. In the context of time series, it addresses distributional shifts by removing varying statistical properties such as mean and standard deviation from the data. This helps to prevent models from performing poorly due to changes in the data distribution over time. The technique standardizes the input data within a window and later reverts it back to its original scale for predictions. In CycleNet, this is implemented outside of the input and output steps using instance normalization, inspired by methods like RevIN.\n\n    1. Normalize the input window \\( x_{t-L+1:t} \\):\n    \\[\n   x_{t-L+1:t} = \\frac{x_{t-L+1:t} - \\mu}{\\sqrt{\\sigma + \\epsilon}}\n   \\]\n   where \\(\\mu\\) is the mean of the input window, \\(\\sigma\\) is the standard deviation of the input window, and \\(\\epsilon\\) is a small constant for numerical stability.\n\n    2. Re-normalize the prediction \\( \\hat{x}_{t+1:t+H} \\):\n   \\[\n   \\hat{x}_{t+1:t+H} = \\hat{x}_{t+1:t+H} \\times \\sqrt{\\sigma + \\epsilon} + \\mu\n   \\]\n   Here, \\( \\hat{x}_{t+1:t+H} \\) is the model's predicted output, \\(\\mu\\) and \\(\\sigma\\) are the mean and standard deviation of the input window, and \\(\\epsilon\\) ensures numerical stability.\n\n\n6. **Loss Function:**\n    - CycleNet defaults to using Mean Squared Error (MSE) as the loss function to ensure fair comparison with other methods, formulated as:\n        - Loss = \\( \\| x_{t+1:t+H} - \\bar{x}_{t+1:t+H} \\|_2^2 \\)\n\n7. **Evaluation Metrics:**\n    - MSE (Mean Squared Error)\n    - MAE (Mean Absolute Error)\n\n\n8. **Experiment Detail:**\n- We utilized widely used benchmark datasets for LTSF tasks, including the ETT series, Electricity, Solar-Energy, Traffic, and Weather. Following prior works such as Autoformer and iTransformer, we split the ETTs dataset into training, validation, and test sets with a ratio of 6:2:2, while the other datasets were split in a ratio of 7:1:2. \n- We implemented CycleNet using PyTorch and conducted experiments on a single NVIDIA RTX 4090 GPU with 24GB of memory. CycleNet was trained for 30 epochs with early stopping based on a patience of 5 on the validation set. The batch size was set uniformly to 256 for ETTs and the Weather dataset, and 64 for the remaining datasets. This adjustment was made because the latter datasets have a larger number of channels, requiring a relatively smaller batch size to avoid out-of-memory issues. The learning rate was selected from the range {0.002, 0.005, 0.01} based on the performance on the validation set. The hyperparameter W was set consistently to the pre-inferred cycle length. Additionally, the hidden layer size of CycleNet/MLP was uniformly set to 512. By default, CycleNet uses RevIN without learnable affine parameters. However, we found that on the Solar dataset, using RevIN leads to a significant performance drop. The primary reason for this may be that photovoltaic power generation data contains continuous segments of zero values (no power generation at night). When the look-back windows are not an integer multiple of a day, the calculation of means in RevIN can be significantly affected, leading to decreased performance. Therefore, for this dataset, we did not apply the RevIN strategy.",

Preprocessing the data, setting up scripts, training, and evaluating the model are considered non-core components, as they involve standard operations like loading data, configuring parameters, and computing metrics, which do not contribute to the novel method itself. There are no ambiguous components; all steps are clearly defined in terms of their roles and requirements."

            "question": "Does the CycleNet/MLP model perform better than TimeMixer and iTransformer on the Traffic forecasting task?",
            "method": "1. **Problem Setup:** \n    - **Task:** \n    Compare the performance of CycleNet/MLP against TimeMixer and iTransformer on the Traffic forecasting task.\n    - **Objective:** \n    Evaluate whether CycleNet/MLP achieves better forecasting accuracy than TimeMixer and iTransformer.\n\n2. **Testing Dataset:** \n    - Traffic (time series forecasting tasks)\n    - Preprocessing operations on the datasets, such as dataset splitting and normalization methods, remained consistent with prior works (e.g., Autoformer [Haixu Wu, Jiehui Xu, Jianmin Wang, and Mingsheng Long. Autoformer: Decomposition transformers with auto-correlation for long-term series forecasting. Advances in neural information processing systems, 34:22419\u201322430, 2021.], iTransformer [Yong Liu, Tengge Hu, Haoran Zhang, Haixu Wu, Shiyu Wang, Lintao Ma, and Mingsheng Long. itransformer: Inverted transformers are effective for time series forecasting. In The Twelfth International Conference on Learning Representations, 2024.], etc.).\n3. **Comparative Evaluation:**  \n    - Models:\n        - CycleNet with MLP backbone (Proposed model)\n        - iTransformer (Baseline model)\n        - TimeMixer (Baseline model)\n\n4. **Training Detail:**\n    - Fixed look-back window (L=96)\n    - Forecast horizons (H \u2208 {96, 192, 336, 720})\n    - Use PyTorch and Adam optimizer for training\n    - Utilize an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 GPU for training\n\n5. **Normalization detail:**\n    - Normalization is a technique used to standardize the range of independent variables or features of data. In the context of time series, it addresses distributional shifts by removing varying statistical properties such as mean and standard deviation from the data. This helps to prevent models from performing poorly due to changes in the data distribution over time. The technique standardizes the input data within a window and later reverts it back to its original scale for predictions. In CycleNet, this is implemented outside of the input and output steps using instance normalization, inspired by methods like RevIN.\n\n    1. Normalize the input window \\( x_{t-L+1:t} \\):\n    \\[\n   x_{t-L+1:t} = \\frac{x_{t-L+1:t} - \\mu}{\\sqrt{\\sigma + \\epsilon}}\n   \\]\n   where \\(\\mu\\) is the mean of the input window, \\(\\sigma\\) is the standard deviation of the input window, and \\(\\epsilon\\) is a small constant for numerical stability.\n\n    2. Re-normalize the prediction \\( \\hat{x}_{t+1:t+H} \\):\n   \\[\n   \\hat{x}_{t+1:t+H} = \\hat{x}_{t+1:t+H} \\times \\sqrt{\\sigma + \\epsilon} + \\mu\n   \\]\n   Here, \\( \\hat{x}_{t+1:t+H} \\) is the model's predicted output, \\(\\mu\\) and \\(\\sigma\\) are the mean and standard deviation of the input window, and \\(\\epsilon\\) ensures numerical stability.\n\n\n6. **Loss Function:**\n    - CycleNet defaults to using Mean Squared Error (MSE) as the loss function to ensure fair comparison with other methods, formulated as:\n        - Loss = \\( \\| x_{t+1:t+H} - \\bar{x}_{t+1:t+H} \\|_2^2 \\)\n\n7. **Evaluation Metrics:**\n    - MSE (Mean Squared Error)\n    - MAE (Mean Absolute Error)\n\n8. **Experiment Detail:**\n- We utilized widely used benchmark datasets for LTSF tasks, including the ETT series, Electricity, Solar-Energy, Traffic, and Weather. Following prior works such as Autoformer and iTransformer, we split the ETTs dataset into training, validation, and test sets with a ratio of 6:2:2, while the other datasets were split in a ratio of 7:1:2. \n- We implemented CycleNet using PyTorch and conducted experiments on a single NVIDIA RTX 4090 GPU with 24GB of memory. CycleNet was trained for 30 epochs with early stopping based on a patience of 5 on the validation set. The batch size was set uniformly to 256 for ETTs and the Weather dataset, and 64 for the remaining datasets. This adjustment was made because the latter datasets have a larger number of channels, requiring a relatively smaller batch size to avoid out-of-memory issues. The learning rate was selected from the range {0.002, 0.005, 0.01} based on the performance on the validation set. The hyperparameter W was set consistently to the pre-inferred cycle length. Additionally, the hidden layer size of CycleNet/MLP was uniformly set to 512. By default, CycleNet uses RevIN without learnable affine parameters. However, we found that on the Solar dataset, using RevIN leads to a significant performance drop. The primary reason for this may be that photovoltaic power generation data contains continuous segments of zero values (no power generation at night). When the look-back windows are not an integer multiple of a day, the calculation of means in RevIN can be significantly affected, leading to decreased performance. Therefore, for this dataset, we did not apply the RevIN strategy.",
            "expected_outcome": "CycleNet\u2019s performance on the Traffic dataset is expected to be inferior to iTransformer, as iTransformer effectively models multivariate relationships using an inverted Transformer, which is better suited for capturing the spatiotemporal dependencies and temporal lag characteristics of traffic flow data.

            "question": "Does the integration of the RCF technique enhance the prediction accuracy of basic backbones (Linear and MLP) compared to using the same backbones without RCF?",
            "method": "1. **Problem Setup:** \n    - **Task:** \n    Assess whether incorporating the RCF technique improves the forecasting accuracy of CycleNet\u2019s Linear and MLP backbones.\n    - **Objective:** \n    Quantify the improvement in accuracy by comparing models with and without RCF.\n\n2. **Testing Dataset:** \n    - Electricity and Traffic (time series forecasting tasks with strong periodicity)\n    - Preprocessing operations on the datasets, such as dataset splitting and normalization methods, remained consistent with prior works (e.g., Autoformer [Haixu Wu, Jiehui Xu, Jianmin Wang, and Mingsheng Long. Autoformer: Decomposition transformers with auto-correlation for long-term series forecasting. Advances in neural information processing systems, 34:22419\u201322430, 2021.], iTransformer [Yong Liu, Tengge Hu, Haoran Zhang, Haixu Wu, Shiyu Wang, Lintao Ma, and Mingsheng Long. itransformer: Inverted transformers are effective for time series forecasting. In The Twelfth International Conference on Learning Representations, 2024.], etc.).\n3. **Comparative Evaluation:**  \n    - Models:\n        - Linear + RCF vs. Linear (without RCF)\n        - MLP + RCF vs. MLP (without RCF)\n\n4. **Training Detail:**\n    - Fixed look-back window (L=96)\n    - Forecast horizons (H \u2208 {96, 192, 336, 720})\n    - Use PyTorch and Adam optimizer for training\n    - Utilize an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 GPU for training\n\n5. **Normalization detail:**\n    - Normalization is a technique used to standardize the range of independent variables or features of data. In the context of time series, it addresses distributional shifts by removing varying statistical properties such as mean and standard deviation from the data. This helps to prevent models from performing poorly due to changes in the data distribution over time. The technique standardizes the input data within a window and later reverts it back to its original scale for predictions. In CycleNet, this is implemented outside of the input and output steps using instance normalization, inspired by methods like RevIN.\n\n    1. Normalize the input window \\( x_{t-L+1:t} \\):\n    \\[\n   x_{t-L+1:t} = \\frac{x_{t-L+1:t} - \\mu}{\\sqrt{\\sigma + \\epsilon}}\n   \\]\n   where \\(\\mu\\) is the mean of the input window, \\(\\sigma\\) is the standard deviation of the input window, and \\(\\epsilon\\) is a small constant for numerical stability.\n\n    2. Re-normalize the prediction \\( \\hat{x}_{t+1:t+H} \\):\n   \\[\n   \\hat{x}_{t+1:t+H} = \\hat{x}_{t+1:t+H} \\times \\sqrt{\\sigma + \\epsilon} + \\mu\n   \\]\n   Here, \\( \\hat{x}_{t+1:t+H} \\) is the model's predicted output, \\(\\mu\\) and \\(\\sigma\\) are the mean and standard deviation of the input window, and \\(\\epsilon\\) ensures numerical stability.\n\n\n6. **Loss Function:**\n    - CycleNet defaults to using Mean Squared Error (MSE) as the loss function to ensure fair comparison with other methods, formulated as:\n        - Loss = \\( \\| x_{t+1:t+H} - \\bar{x}_{t+1:t+H} \\|_2^2 \\)\n\n7. **Evaluation Metrics:**\n    - MSE (Mean Squared Error)\n    - MAE (Mean Absolute Error)\n\n8. **Experiment Detail:**\n- We utilized widely used benchmark datasets for LTSF tasks, including the ETT series, Electricity, Solar-Energy, Traffic, and Weather. Following prior works such as Autoformer and iTransformer, we split the ETTs dataset into training, validation, and test sets with a ratio of 6:2:2, while the other datasets were split in a ratio of 7:1:2. \n- We implemented CycleNet using PyTorch and conducted experiments on a single NVIDIA RTX 4090 GPU with 24GB of memory. CycleNet was trained for 30 epochs with early stopping based on a patience of 5 on the validation set. The batch size was set uniformly to 256 for ETTs and the Weather dataset, and 64 for the remaining datasets. This adjustment was made because the latter datasets have a larger number of channels, requiring a relatively smaller batch size to avoid out-of-memory issues. The learning rate was selected from the range {0.002, 0.005, 0.01} based on the performance on the validation set. The hyperparameter W was set consistently to the pre-inferred cycle length. Additionally, the hidden layer size of CycleNet/MLP was uniformly set to 512. By default, CycleNet uses RevIN without learnable affine parameters. However, we found that on the Solar dataset, using RevIN leads to a significant performance drop. The primary reason for this may be that photovoltaic power generation data contains continuous segments of zero values (no power generation at night). When the look-back windows are not an integer multiple of a day, the calculation of means in RevIN can be significantly affected, leading to decreased performance. Therefore, for this dataset, we did not apply the RevIN strategy.",
            "expected_outcome": "The results are expected to demonstrate that integrating RCF significantly enhances prediction accuracy for both Linear and MLP backbones. The anticipated improvement ranges from 10% to 20% across different forecast horizons, reinforcing the importance of modeling global periodic patterns through the RCF technique. Consistent performance gains across Electricity and Traffic datasets would further validate its effectiveness.",

            "method": "1. **Problem Setup:** \n    - **Task:** \n    Compare the performance of CycleNet leveraging the RCF technique against the iTransformer model on time series forecasting tasks.\n    - **Objective:** \n    Determine whether the CycleNet model achieves better forecasting accuracy as measured by MSE and MAE on the ETTh1 & ETTh2 datasets.\n\n2. **Testing Dataset:** \n    - ETTh1 & ETTh2 (time series forecasting tasks)\n    - Preprocessing operations on the datasets, such as dataset splitting and normalization methods, remained consistent with prior works (e.g., Autoformer [Haixu Wu, Jiehui Xu, Jianmin Wang, and Mingsheng Long. Autoformer: Decomposition transformers with auto-correlation for long-term series forecasting. Advances in neural information processing systems, 34:22419\u201322430, 2021.], iTransformer [Yong Liu, Tengge Hu, Haoran Zhang, Haixu Wu, Shiyu Wang, Lintao Ma, and Mingsheng Long. itransformer: Inverted transformers are effective for time series forecasting. In The Twelfth International Conference on Learning Representations, 2024.], etc.).\n3. **Comparative Evaluation:**  \n    - Models:\n        - iTransformer (Baseline model)\n        - CycleNet (Proposed model with MLP and Linear backbones)\n\n4. **Training Detail:**\n    - Fixed look-back window (L=96)\n    - Forecast horizons (H \u2208 {96, 192, 336, 720})\n    - Use PyTorch and Adam optimizer for training\n    - Utilize an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 GPU for training\n\n5. **Normalization detail:**\n    - Normalization is a technique used to standardize the range of independent variables or features of data. In the context of time series, it addresses distributional shifts by removing varying statistical properties such as mean and standard deviation from the data. This helps to prevent models from performing poorly due to changes in the data distribution over time. The technique standardizes the input data within a window and later reverts it back to its original scale for predictions. In CycleNet, this is implemented outside of the input and output steps using instance normalization, inspired by methods like RevIN.\n\n    1. Normalize the input window \\( x_{t-L+1:t} \\):\n    \\[\n   x_{t-L+1:t} = \\frac{x_{t-L+1:t} - \\mu}{\\sqrt{\\sigma + \\epsilon}}\n   \\]\n   where \\(\\mu\\) is the mean of the input window, \\(\\sigma\\) is the standard deviation of the input window, and \\(\\epsilon\\) is a small constant for numerical stability.\n\n    2. Re-normalize the prediction \\( \\hat{x}_{t+1:t+H} \\):\n   \\[\n   \\hat{x}_{t+1:t+H} = \\hat{x}_{t+1:t+H} \\times \\sqrt{\\sigma + \\epsilon} + \\mu\n   \\]\n   Here, \\( \\hat{x}_{t+1:t+H} \\) is the model's predicted output, \\(\\mu\\) and \\(\\sigma\\) are the mean and standard deviation of the input window, and \\(\\epsilon\\) ensures numerical stability.\n\n\n6. **Loss Function:**\n    - CycleNet defaults to using Mean Squared Error (MSE) as the loss function to ensure fair comparison with other methods, formulated as:\n        - Loss = \\( \\| x_{t+1:t+H} - \\bar{x}_{t+1:t+H} \\|_2^2 \\)\n\n7. **Evaluation Metrics:**\n    - MSE (Mean Squared Error)\n    - MAE (Mean Absolute Error)\n\n8. **Experiment Detail:**\n- We utilized widely used benchmark datasets for LTSF tasks, including the ETT series, Electricity, Solar-Energy, Traffic, and Weather. Following prior works such as Autoformer and iTransformer, we split the ETTs dataset into training, validation, and test sets with a ratio of 6:2:2, while the other datasets were split in a ratio of 7:1:2. \n- We implemented CycleNet using PyTorch and conducted experiments on a single NVIDIA RTX 4090 GPU with 24GB of memory. CycleNet was trained for 30 epochs with early stopping based on a patience of 5 on the validation set. The batch size was set uniformly to 256 for ETTs and the Weather dataset, and 64 for the remaining datasets. This adjustment was made because the latter datasets have a larger number of channels, requiring a relatively smaller batch size to avoid out-of-memory issues. The learning rate was selected from the range {0.002, 0.005, 0.01} based on the performance on the validation set. The hyperparameter W was set consistently to the pre-inferred cycle length. Additionally, the hidden layer size of CycleNet/MLP was uniformly set to 512. By default, CycleNet uses RevIN without learnable affine parameters. However, we found that on the Solar dataset, using RevIN leads to a significant performance drop. The primary reason for this may be that photovoltaic power generation data contains continuous segments of zero values (no power generation at night). When the look-back windows are not an integer multiple of a day, the calculation of means in RevIN can be significantly affected, leading to decreased performance. Therefore, for this dataset, we did not apply the RevIN strategy.",

            "question": "Does the integration of the RCF technique enhance the prediction accuracy of existing models, DLinear, PatchTST, and iTransformer, compared to using the same models without RCF?",
            "method": "1. **Problem Setup:** \n    - **Task:** \n    Assess whether adding the RCF technique improves the forecasting accuracy of widely used models.\n    - **Objective:** \n    Quantify the performance improvement in existing models when integrating RCF.\n\n2. **Testing Dataset:** \n    - Electricity dataset (time series forecasting tasks)\n    - Preprocessing operations on the datasets, such as dataset splitting and normalization methods, remained consistent with prior works (e.g., Autoformer [Haixu Wu, Jiehui Xu, Jianmin Wang, and Mingsheng Long. Autoformer: Decomposition transformers with auto-correlation for long-term series forecasting. Advances in neural information processing systems, 34:22419\u201322430, 2021.], iTransformer [Yong Liu, Tengge Hu, Haoran Zhang, Haixu Wu, Shiyu Wang, Lintao Ma, and Mingsheng Long. itransformer: Inverted transformers are effective for time series forecasting. In The Twelfth International Conference on Learning Representations, 2024.], etc.).\n3. **Comparative Evaluation:**  \n    - Models:\n        - DLinear + RCF vs. DLinear (without RCF)\n        - PatchTST + RCF vs. PatchTST (without RCF)\n        - iTransformer + RCF vs. iTransformer (without RCF)\n\n4. **Training Detail:**\n    - Fixed look-back window (L=96)\n    - Forecast horizons (H \u2208 {96, 192, 336, 720})\n    - Use PyTorch and Adam optimizer for training\n    - Utilize an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 GPU for training\n\n5. **Normalization detail:**\n    - Normalization is a technique used to standardize the range of independent variables or features of data. In the context of time series, it addresses distributional shifts by removing varying statistical properties such as mean and standard deviation from the data. This helps to prevent models from performing poorly due to changes in the data distribution over time. The technique standardizes the input data within a window and later reverts it back to its original scale for predictions. In CycleNet, this is implemented outside of the input and output steps using instance normalization, inspired by methods like RevIN.\n\n    1. Normalize the input window \\( x_{t-L+1:t} \\):\n    \\[\n   x_{t-L+1:t} = \\frac{x_{t-L+1:t} - \\mu}{\\sqrt{\\sigma + \\epsilon}}\n   \\]\n   where \\(\\mu\\) is the mean of the input window, \\(\\sigma\\) is the standard deviation of the input window, and \\(\\epsilon\\) is a small constant for numerical stability.\n\n    2. Re-normalize the prediction \\( \\hat{x}_{t+1:t+H} \\):\n   \\[\n   \\hat{x}_{t+1:t+H} = \\hat{x}_{t+1:t+H} \\times \\sqrt{\\sigma + \\epsilon} + \\mu\n   \\]\n   Here, \\( \\hat{x}_{t+1:t+H} \\) is the model's predicted output, \\(\\mu\\) and \\(\\sigma\\) are the mean and standard deviation of the input window, and \\(\\epsilon\\) ensures numerical stability.\n\n\n6. **Loss Function:**\n    - CycleNet defaults to using Mean Squared Error (MSE) as the loss function to ensure fair comparison with other methods, formulated as:\n        - Loss = \\( \\| x_{t+1:t+H} - \\bar{x}_{t+1:t+H} \\|_2^2 \\)\n\n7. **Evaluation Metrics:**\n    - MSE (Mean Squared Error)\n    - MAE (Mean Absolute Error)\n    - report base on score per horizon\n\n8. **Experiment Detail:**\n- We utilized widely used benchmark datasets for LTSF tasks, including the ETT series, Electricity, Solar-Energy, Traffic, and Weather. Following prior works such as Autoformer and iTransformer, we split the ETTs dataset into training, validation, and test sets with a ratio of 6:2:2, while the other datasets were split in a ratio of 7:1:2. \n- We implemented CycleNet using PyTorch and conducted experiments on a single NVIDIA RTX 4090 GPU with 24GB of memory. CycleNet was trained for 30 epochs with early stopping based on a patience of 5 on the validation set. The batch size was set uniformly to 256 for ETTs and the Weather dataset, and 64 for the remaining datasets. This adjustment was made because the latter datasets have a larger number of channels, requiring a relatively smaller batch size to avoid out-of-memory issues. The learning rate was selected from the range {0.002, 0.005, 0.01} based on the performance on the validation set. The hyperparameter W was set consistently to the pre-inferred cycle length. Additionally, the hidden layer size of CycleNet/MLP was uniformly set to 512. By default, CycleNet uses RevIN without learnable affine parameters. However, we found that on the Solar dataset, using RevIN leads to a significant performance drop. The primary reason for this may be that photovoltaic power generation data contains continuous segments of zero values (no power generation at night). When the look-back windows are not an integer multiple of a day, the calculation of means in RevIN can be significantly affected, leading to decreased performance. Therefore, for this dataset, we did not apply the RevIN strategy.",
            "expected_outcome": "It is observed that incorporating RCF still improves the performance of existing complex designed, deep stacked models (approximately 5% to 10%), such as PatchTST and iTransformer. Even for DLinear, which already employs the classical MOV-based STD technique, RCF was able to provide an improvement of approximately 20%. This further indicates the effectiveness and portability of RCF.",

            "method": "1. **Problem Setup:** \n    - **Task:** \n    Compare the effectiveness of RCF-based and Sparse-based trend estimation techniques in time-series forecasting.\n    - **Objective:** \n    Determine whether RCF provides superior forecasting accuracy compared to Sparse when applied to Electricity forecasting.\n\n2. **Testing Dataset:** \n    - Electricity (time series forecasting tasks)\n    - Preprocessing operations on the datasets, such as dataset splitting and normalization methods, remained consistent with prior works (e.g., Autoformer [Haixu Wu, Jiehui Xu, Jianmin Wang, and Mingsheng Long. Autoformer: Decomposition transformers with auto-correlation for long-term series forecasting. Advances in neural information processing systems, 34:22419\u201322430, 2021.], iTransformer [Yong Liu, Tengge Hu, Haoran Zhang, Haixu Wu, Shiyu Wang, Lintao Ma, and Mingsheng Long. itransformer: Inverted transformers are effective for time series forecasting. In The Twelfth International Conference on Learning Representations, 2024.], etc.).\n3. **Comparative Evaluation:**  \n    - Models:\n        - CLinear (RCF + Linear)\n        - SLinear (Sparse + Linear)\n    - Ensure no normalization is applied to isolate the effect of the STD method.\n\n4. **Training Detail:**\n    - Fixed look-back window (L=96)\n    - Forecast horizons (H \u2208 {96, 192, 336, 720})\n    - Use PyTorch and Adam optimizer for training\n    - Utilize an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 GPU for training\n\n5. **Normalization detail:**\n    - no additional instance normalization\n\n6. **Loss Function:**\n    - CycleNet defaults to using Mean Squared Error (MSE) as the loss function to ensure fair comparison with other methods, formulated as:\n        - Loss = \\( \\| x_{t+1:t+H} - \\bar{x}_{t+1:t+H} \\|_2^2 \\)\n\n7. **Evaluation Metrics:**\n    - MSE (Mean Squared Error)\n    - MAE (Mean Absolute Error)\n    - Compute the average performance across all forecast horizons.\n\n8. **Experiment Detail:**\n- We utilized widely used benchmark datasets for LTSF tasks, including the ETT series, Electricity, Solar-Energy, Traffic, and Weather. Following prior works such as Autoformer and iTransformer, we split the ETTs dataset into training, validation, and test sets with a ratio of 6:2:2, while the other datasets were split in a ratio of 7:1:2. \n- We implemented CycleNet using PyTorch and conducted experiments on a single NVIDIA RTX 4090 GPU with 24GB of memory. CycleNet was trained for 30 epochs with early stopping based on a patience of 5 on the validation set. The batch size was set uniformly to 256 for ETTs and the Weather dataset, and 64 for the remaining datasets. This adjustment was made because the latter datasets have a larger number of channels, requiring a relatively smaller batch size to avoid out-of-memory issues. The learning rate was selected from the range {0.002, 0.005, 0.01} based on the performance on the validation set. The hyperparameter W was set consistently to the pre-inferred cycle length. Additionally, the hidden layer size of CycleNet/MLP was uniformly set to 512. By default, CycleNet uses RevIN without learnable affine parameters. However, we found that on the Solar dataset, using RevIN leads to a significant performance drop. The primary reason for this may be that photovoltaic power generation data contains continuous segments of zero values (no power generation at night). When the look-back windows are not an integer multiple of a day, the calculation of means in RevIN can be significantly affected, leading to decreased performance. Therefore, for this dataset, we did not apply the RevIN strategy.\n\n9. **Addtional Note:**\nTo directly compare the effects of STD, the configuration used here is consistent with that of DLinear, with a sufficient look-back window length of 336 and no additional instance normalization strategies. Thus, CLinear here refers to CycleNet/Linear without RevIN.",

                "description": "The training process of CycleNet (e.g., using stochastic gradient descent, random weight initialization, random train/validation/test splits) inherently introduces random uncertainty. These random fluctuations can lead to variations in forecasting performance metrics such as MSE and MAE, and may affect the stability of the learned cyclic components over multiple runs.",
                "impact": "This variability can result in slight differences in prediction accuracy and the visualizations of the learned cyclic components, as seen in the robustness metrics (e.g., the standard deviation mostly below 0.001 in Table 7). It affects the reproducibility of the model if random seeds and splits are not controlled.",

                "description": "Systematic uncertainty may arise from decisions such as setting a fixed cycle length (168 hours) for modeling weekly patterns, predetermined normalization techniques, or a specific epoch number for early stopping. These choices, while necessary, can introduce consistent biases if the underlying data distribution does not fully conform to these assumptions.",
                "impact": "Such biases may lead to persistent over- or under-forecasting across different subsets of the data, thus affecting the overall performance metrics and the interpretation of the visualized cyclic components. This type of error systematically affects all experiments in a similar way, potentially obscuring true performance differences.",

These components implement the novel approach described in the paper\u2014modeling periodic patterns in time series data. Specifically, steps involving setting up the CycleNet model with a RecurrentCycle component (Step 6) and generating forecasts by processing cyclic components (Step 8) are classified as core components because they directly relate to the implementation of the CycleNet architecture, which is the main research contribution of the paper. Other steps, such as setting up the environment (Step 1), configuring model parameters (Step 2), loading and preprocessing data (Steps 3, 4, 5), training the model (Step 7), evaluating performance (Step 9), and visualizing results (Step 10), are considered non-core because they involve orchestration and support logic, rather than implementing the novel algorithm or method. None of the components are ambiguous as they are sufficiently described in the requirements."
