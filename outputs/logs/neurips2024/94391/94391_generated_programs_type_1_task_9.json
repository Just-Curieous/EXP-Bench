    "no_answer": "While the repository contains implementations of DLinear, PatchTST, iTransformer, and the RCF technique, there is no single script or small set of scripts that directly answers the experiment question comparing these models with and without RCF on the Electricity dataset. The repository has scripts for running CycleiTransformer (iTransformer with RCF) and DLinear (without RCF) on the Electricity dataset, but lacks scripts specifically for PatchTST with RCF, PatchTST without RCF, and iTransformer without RCF. The README mentions Table4.png which shows the results of such comparisons, but the repository doesn't provide ready-to-use scripts to reproduce these specific experiments. Creating these experiments would require more extensive modifications to the existing code rather than simple parameter changes."
