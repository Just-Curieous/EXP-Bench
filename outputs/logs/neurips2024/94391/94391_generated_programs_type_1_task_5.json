    "no_answer": "While the repository contains scripts for running CycleNet/MLP on the Traffic dataset, it does not contain scripts for directly comparing it with TimeMixer and the original iTransformer as requested in the experiment question. The repository includes a CycleiTransformer implementation (which combines CycleNet with iTransformer), but not the standalone iTransformer or TimeMixer models needed for the comparison. The repository is primarily focused on demonstrating CycleNet's performance rather than providing comprehensive comparison scripts with all baseline models mentioned in the experiment question."
