  "agent_instructions": "Your task is to create scripts to run time series forecasting experiments comparing CycleNet (with both Linear and MLP backbones) against iTransformer on ETTh1 and ETTh2 datasets. You need to:\n\n1. Create shell scripts to run experiments for:\n   - CycleNet with Linear backbone on ETTh1 and ETTh2\n   - CycleNet with MLP backbone on ETTh1 and ETTh2\n   - iTransformer on ETTh1 and ETTh2\n\n2. Each script should:\n   - Set appropriate model configurations (model name, dataset paths, etc.)\n   - Run experiments with multiple forecast horizons (96, 192, 336, 720)\n   - Use multiple random seeds (2024-2028) for statistical significance\n   - Configure appropriate hyperparameters for each model\n\n3. For CycleNet:\n   - Use a cycle length of 24 (representing daily patterns)\n   - For Linear backbone: use learning rate of 0.01\n   - For MLP backbone: use learning rate of 0.005\n   - Enable RevIN normalization\n\n4. For iTransformer:\n   - Use appropriate transformer configurations (d_model=512, d_ff=512, etc.)\n   - Set e_layers=3 and learning rate of 0.0001\n\n5. All experiments should:\n   - Use a sequence length (input length) of 96\n   - Train for up to 30 epochs with early stopping (patience=5)\n   - Use MSE as the loss function\n   - Evaluate using MSE and MAE metrics\n\nThe goal is to compare the forecasting performance of these models across different prediction horizons on the ETT datasets.",
