      "question": "Does CycleNet/MLP model perform better than CycleNet/Linear on the Solar-Energy forecasting task?",
      "method": "1. **Problem Setup:** \n    - **Task:** \n    Compare the performance of CycleNet with MLP and Linear backbones on the Solar-Energy forecasting task.\n    - **Objective:** \n    Determine whether CycleNet/MLP performs better than CycleNet/Linear in terms of forecasting accuracy on the Solar-Energy dataset.\n\n2. **Testing Dataset:** \n    - Solar-Energy (time series forecasting task)\n    - Preprocessing operations on the datasets, such as dataset splitting and normalization methods, remained consistent with prior works (e.g., Autoformer [Haixu Wu, Jiehui Xu, Jianmin Wang, and Mingsheng Long. Autoformer: Decomposition transformers with auto-correlation for long-term series forecasting. Advances in neural information processing systems, 34:22419\u201322430, 2021.], iTransformer [Yong Liu, Tengge Hu, Haoran Zhang, Haixu Wu, Shiyu Wang, Lintao Ma, and Mingsheng Long. itransformer: Inverted transformers are effective for time series forecasting. In The Twelfth International Conference on Learning Representations, 2024.], etc.).\n3. **Comparative Evaluation:**  \n    - Models:\n        - CycleNet with MLP backbone (Proposed model)\n        - CycleNet with Linear backbone (Baseline model)\n\n4. **Training Detail:**\n    - Fixed look-back window (L=96)\n    - Forecast horizons (H \u2208 {96, 192, 336, 720})\n    - Use PyTorch and Adam optimizer for training\n    - Utilize an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 GPU for training\n\n5. **Normalization detail:**\n    - Normalization is a technique used to standardize the range of independent variables or features of data. In the context of time series, it addresses distributional shifts by removing varying statistical properties such as mean and standard deviation from the data. This helps to prevent models from performing poorly due to changes in the data distribution over time. The technique standardizes the input data within a window and later reverts it back to its original scale for predictions. In CycleNet, this is implemented outside of the input and output steps using instance normalization, inspired by methods like RevIN.\n\n    1. Normalize the input window \\( x_{t-L+1:t} \\):\n    \\[\n   x_{t-L+1:t} = \\frac{x_{t-L+1:t} - \\mu}{\\sqrt{\\sigma + \\epsilon}}\n   \\]\n   where \\(\\mu\\) is the mean of the input window, \\(\\sigma\\) is the standard deviation of the input window, and \\(\\epsilon\\) is a small constant for numerical stability.\n\n    2. Re-normalize the prediction \\( \\hat{x}_{t+1:t+H} \\):\n   \\[\n   \\hat{x}_{t+1:t+H} = \\hat{x}_{t+1:t+H} \\times \\sqrt{\\sigma + \\epsilon} + \\mu\n   \\]\n   Here, \\( \\hat{x}_{t+1:t+H} \\) is the model's predicted output, \\(\\mu\\) and \\(\\sigma\\) are the mean and standard deviation of the input window, and \\(\\epsilon\\) ensures numerical stability.\n\n\n6. **Loss Function:**\n    - CycleNet defaults to using Mean Squared Error (MSE) as the loss function to ensure fair comparison with other methods, formulated as:\n        - Loss = \\( \\| x_{t+1:t+H} - \\bar{x}_{t+1:t+H} \\|_2^2 \\)\n\n7. **Evaluation Metrics:**\n    - MSE (Mean Squared Error)\n    - MAE (Mean Absolute Error)\n\n\n8. **Experiment Detail:**\n- We utilized widely used benchmark datasets for LTSF tasks, including the ETT series, Electricity, Solar-Energy, Traffic, and Weather. Following prior works such as Autoformer and iTransformer, we split the ETTs dataset into training, validation, and test sets with a ratio of 6:2:2, while the other datasets were split in a ratio of 7:1:2. \n- We implemented CycleNet using PyTorch and conducted experiments on a single NVIDIA RTX 4090 GPU with 24GB of memory. CycleNet was trained for 30 epochs with early stopping based on a patience of 5 on the validation set. The batch size was set uniformly to 256 for ETTs and the Weather dataset, and 64 for the remaining datasets. This adjustment was made because the latter datasets have a larger number of channels, requiring a relatively smaller batch size to avoid out-of-memory issues. The learning rate was selected from the range {0.002, 0.005, 0.01} based on the performance on the validation set. The hyperparameter W was set consistently to the pre-inferred cycle length. Additionally, the hidden layer size of CycleNet/MLP was uniformly set to 512. By default, CycleNet uses RevIN without learnable affine parameters. However, we found that on the Solar dataset, using RevIN leads to a significant performance drop. The primary reason for this may be that photovoltaic power generation data contains continuous segments of zero values (no power generation at night). When the look-back windows are not an integer multiple of a day, the calculation of means in RevIN can be significantly affected, leading to decreased performance. Therefore, for this dataset, we did not apply the RevIN strategy.",
      "expected_outcome": "It is expected that CycleNet/MLP will achieve significantly lower error metrics (MSE and MAE) than CycleNet/Linear on the Solar-Energy forecasting task, due to the nonlinear mapping capability of MLP compared to Linear. CycleNet/MLP is expected to perform better on high-dimensional datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of the MLP backbone in capturing complex patterns.",
