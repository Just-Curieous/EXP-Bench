Use the provided annotations and multi-view images (7 views for subset A) to perform lane and traffic element detection as well as topology prediction. For each method, compute the mean average precision (mAP) values for DETl and DETt (using Fr\u00e9chet distance over thresholds for lanes and IoU over categories for traffic) and the graph-based TOP scores (with appropriate thresholds) to obtain TOPll and TOPlt. Finally, calculate the overall OpenLane-V2 Score (OLS) as the square-root average of the individual metrics. Compare the results in a controlled manner, and analyze if TopoMLP has statistically significant better performance compared to the others.",

Compare the performance of TopoMLP with that of other methods (STSU, VectorMapNet, MapTR, TopoNet) on metrics including DETl, DETt, TOPll, TOPlt, and OLS. The method involves running the models on the dataset, collecting prediction outputs, computing the mAP based metrics for detection and topology, and finally analyzing the improvements in performance across different backbone choices. Statistical tests can be applied to determine if the differences are significant.",

Compare the performance differences among the three variants as presented in Table 3 (c).",

First, run the detection and topology estimation pipelines with the default prediction scores (where unmatched false positives have a default high confidence of 1.0). Record the metrics DETl, DETt, TOPll, TOPlt, and OLS. Next, implement the enhanced prediction strategy: re-rank the outputs so that the true positives receive higher confidences (e.g., adjust scores to push true positives over the 0.5 threshold while demoting unmatched false positives). Re-run the evaluation with these adjusted scores. Finally, compare both sets of metrics to quantify the impact of enhanced prediction, noting the degree of improvement in each metric.",

For instance, TopoMLP should see an increase in TOPll by approximately 11.8 points (from 7.2 to 19.0) and similar improvements for TopoNet, demonstrating that a reordering strategy that boosts true positives effectively improves overall topology evaluation.",

This adjusted metric employs an enhanced precision score (P(v)\u2020) that integrates a correction factor based on the ratio of true positives (NTP) to the sum of true positives and false positives (NTP + NFP). Evaluate and record the metrics for both methods under both TOP formulations. Compare how the adjusted metric stabilizes the performance evaluation by reducing the negative influence of high confidence false positives.",

Specifically, despite the changed weighting from false positives, TopoMLP should continue to outperform TopoNet (as the adjusted values still favor TopoMLP) and the overall metric should better reflect the true performance by minimizing the distortive effect introduced by the default high confidence assigned to unmatched instances.",
