      "hypothesis": "Does the integration of lane coordinate embedding and L1 loss for intersection point supervision improve lane-lane topology reasoning?",
      "method": "Evaluate the impact of explicit lane position cues on topology reasoning by conducting experiments on the OpenLane-V2 subset A. Three variants of the model will be tested: (1) the full model with both lane coordinate embedding and L1 loss supervision; (2) a model variant without the lane coordinate embedding ('w/o position'); and (3) a model variant without the L1 loss supervision ('w/o L1 loss'). For each variant, measure the performance on lane detection and topology reasoning using the metrics DETl, DETt, TOPll, TOPlt, and OLS. In particular, pay close attention to the TOPll metric, which quantifies the lane-lane topology performance. Use the performance figures as documented in Table 3(c), where the full model achieves TOPll of 7.2 (with DETl of 28.3, DETt of 50.0, TOPlt of 22.8, and OLS of 38.2), the w/o position variant shows a decrease to a TOPll of 6.9 (with DETl of 27.9, DETt of 50.9, TOPlt of 21.6, and OLS of 37.9), and the w/o L1 loss variant further declines to a TOPll of 6.5 (with DETl of 26.6, DETt of 50.9, TOPlt of 22.1, and OLS of 37.5). This detailed experimental setup will enable a clear comparison of the effect of each component on overall topology reasoning performance.",
      "expected_outcome": "It is anticipated that removing the lane coordinate embedding will result in a slight degradation of the TOPll metric (and related performance metrics), while removing the L1 loss supervision will further deteriorate performance. These outcomes would confirm that both the lane coordinate embedding and the L1 loss for intersection (or lane point) supervision significantly contribute to accurate lane-lane topology reasoning.",

      "usage_instructions": "To evaluate the impact of lane coordinate embedding and L1 loss for intersection point supervision on topology reasoning, you need to create three configuration variants and run the test script on each. \n\n1. First, create the three configuration variants:\n   - For the full model: Use the existing config at `/workspace/projects/configs/topomlp_setA_r50_wo_yolov8.py`\n   - For the 'w/o position' variant: Create a copy of the base config and modify the lane head by setting `with_position=False` (line 112)\n   - For the 'w/o L1 loss' variant: Create a copy of the base config and modify the TopoLLHead by setting `loss_ll_l1_weight=0` (line 175)\n\n2. Then run the test script on each variant with a pre-trained model checkpoint:\n   ```\n   ./tools/dist_test.sh /workspace/projects/configs/topomlp_setA_r50_wo_yolov8.py /path/to/checkpoint.pth 1 --eval=bbox\n   ```\n\n3. The test script will output the performance metrics including DETl, DETt, TOPll, TOPlt, and OLS, which can be compared to evaluate the impact of each component on topology reasoning performance.",
