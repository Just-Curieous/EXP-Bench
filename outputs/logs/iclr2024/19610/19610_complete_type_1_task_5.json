      "hypothesis": "Will adjusting the number of lane queries affect lane detection and lane-lane topology performance?",
      "method": "Run an experiment on the OpenLane-V2 subset A by varying the number of lane queries among three settings: 200, 300, and 500. Use a fixed configuration for the lane detector, for instance, employing a ResNet-50 backbone with a lane detection head composed of 6 transformer decoder layers and a fixed number of control points (set to 4, with control points transformed into 11 lane points for loss calculation). Keep other parameters unchanged including the feature extraction settings, spatial region settings (e.g., X-axis within [\u221251.2m, 51.2m], Y-axis within [\u221225.6m, 25.6m], Z-axis within [\u22128m, 4m]), and training settings. Evaluate the performance based on the metrics DETl, DETt, TOPll, TOPlt, and OLS as previously reported. In particular, refer to the values in Table 3 (a): 200 queries yield DETl 28.2, DETt 49.9, TOPll 6.1, TOPlt 20.2, and OLS 36.9; 300 queries yield DETl 28.3, DETt 50.0, TOPll 7.2, TOPlt 22.8, and OLS 38.2; 500 queries yield DETl 27.9, DETt 49.6, TOPll 7.3, TOPlt 22.4, and OLS 38.0. The experiment will compare these results to determine whether increasing from 200 to 300 queries significantly improves performance, and if further increasing to 500 queries yields additional improvements or leads to degradation.",
      "expected_outcome": "Based on the reported results, it is expected that performance improves when increasing the number of lane queries from 200 to 300, with a notable improvement in the lane-lane topology prediction (e.g., TOPll increases from 6.1 to 7.2) and overall detection quality. However, further increasing the number of lane queries to 500 may not contribute significant additional improvements, and might even slightly degrade some metrics, suggesting that a balanced setting of 300 queries offers the optimal trade-off between detection performance and model complexity.",

      "usage_instructions": "To run the experiment comparing different numbers of lane queries (200, 300, and 500), you need to create three modified versions of the configuration file and run training and evaluation for each. Here's how:\n\n1. Create three configuration files based on topomlp_setA_r50_wo_yolov8.py with the following modifications:\n   - For 200 queries: Copy the file and modify line 38 to `num_lanes_one2one=200` and line 37 to `num_lane=1700` (200+1500)\n   - For 300 queries: Use the existing config (already set to 300 queries)\n   - For 500 queries: Copy the file and modify line 38 to `num_lanes_one2one=500` and line 37 to `num_lane=2000` (500+1500)\n\n2.
