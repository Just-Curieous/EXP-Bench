      "hypothesis": "Does employing a more powerful backbone (e.g., Swin-B) and extending training epochs improve performance metrics compared to the baseline ResNet-50 setup?",
      "method": "Run parallel experiments on OpenLane-V2 subset A using two different configurations. In the first configuration, use ResNet-50 as the backbone with the standard training setup (24 epochs). In the second configuration, use a more powerful backbone (Swin-B) and train for 48 epochs. All other components (e.g., data preprocessing, augmentation, loss settings, query numbers) should remain constant. Evaluate and compare the Overall Lane Score (OLS) along with any available topology metrics. Document the differences; for instance, the paper notes an improvement from an OLS score of 38.2 to 43.7 when using Swin-B.",
      "expected_outcome": "The experiment is expected to show that using a more powerful backbone with extended training leads to a significant improvement in performance metrics, providing evidence that architecture and training duration contribute to enhanced model performance.",

      "usage_instructions": "To run the experiment comparing ResNet-50 and Swin-B backbones on OpenLane-V2 subset A, follow these steps:\n\n1. First, train the baseline ResNet-50 model for 24 epochs (default setting):\n   ```\n   ./tools/dist_train.sh projects/configs/topomlp_setA_r50_wo_yolov8.py 8 --work-dir=./work_dirs/topomlp_setA_r50_wo_yolov8\n   ```\n\n2. For the Swin-B model with extended training, modify the config file by changing line 311 in projects/configs/topomlp_setA_swinb_wo_yolov8.py from `runner = dict(type='EpochBasedRunner', max_epochs=24)` to `runner = dict(type='EpochBasedRunner', max_epochs=48)`, then run:\n   ```\n   ./tools/dist_train.sh projects/configs/topomlp_setA_swinb_wo_yolov8.py 8 --work-dir=./work_dirs/topomlp_setA_swinb_wo_yolov8_e48\n   ```\n\n3. After training, evaluate both models to compare their performance:\n   ```\n   ./tools/dist_test.sh projects/configs/topomlp_setA_r50_wo_yolov8.py work_dirs/topomlp_setA_r50_wo_yolov8/latest.pth 8 --eval=bbox\n   ./tools/dist_test.sh projects/configs/topomlp_setA_swinb_wo_yolov8.py work_dirs/topomlp_setA_swinb_wo_yolov8_e48/latest.pth 8 --eval=bbox\n   ```\n\nThe evaluation will output the Overall Lane Score (OLS) and other topology metrics, allowing you to compare the performance between the ResNet-50 baseline and the Swin-B model with extended training. According to the paper, this should show an improvement from an OLS score of 38.2 to 43.7 when using Swin-B with extended training.",
