    "no_answer": "After thoroughly exploring the repository, I couldn't find a specific script that directly implements the re-ranking of detection confidences as described in the experiment question. The repository contains the necessary components for evaluation (tools/test.py) and the dataset handling (projects/topomlp/datasets/openlane_v2_dataset_subset_a.py), but there's no explicit implementation for adjusting prediction scores to prioritize true positives over false positives. The format_preds function in the dataset file handles the formatting of predictions for evaluation, but doesn't include the re-ranking strategy mentioned in the experiment question. This would likely require implementing a custom script that modifies the confidence scores before evaluation."
