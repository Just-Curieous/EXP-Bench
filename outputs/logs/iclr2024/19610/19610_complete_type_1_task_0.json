      "hypothesis": "TopoMLP, when trained under identical conditions (e.g., 24 epochs with the ResNet-50 backbone, using images resized to 1550\u00d72048 and down-sampled by a factor of 0.5), will outperform existing state-of-the-art methods (STSU, VectorMapNet, MapTR, TopoNet) on OpenLane-V2 subset A. Its superior performance will be evidenced by higher scores in lane detection (DETl and DETt measured using Fr\u00e9chet distance and IoU thresholds, respectively), lane-lane topology (TOPll and TOPlt), and the overall OpenLane-V2 Score (OLS) computed as a square-root average of these metrics.",
      "method": "Using the OpenLane-V2 subset A, which includes multi-view images (typically 7 view images per scenario) and provided annotations, conduct controlled experiments where each method\u2014STSU, VectorMapNet, MapTR, TopoNet, and TopoMLP\u2014is trained for 24 epochs using the ResNet-50 backbone. Preprocess the images by resizing them to 1550\u00d72048 and applying a down-sampling ratio of 0.5. During training, use a consistent batch size (e.g., 8 on GPUs) and ensure that during inference, each model outputs at most 300 lanes. For each model, perform both lane and traffic element detection as well as lane-lane topology prediction. Compute the following metrics: (a) DETl and DETt, representing the mean average precision for lane detection (using Fr\u00e9chet distance thresholds for lane centerlines and IoU for traffic categories), (b) graph-based topology scores TOPll and TOPlt, which involve projecting the ground-truth graph onto the predicted graph using vertex matching (with edge confidence thresholds of 0.5), and (c) the overall OLS metric, defined as a square-root average of the individual metrics. Additionally, incorporate analysis parameters such as varying lane queries (e.g., 200, 300, 500) and control points settings to assess model robustness and the impact on performance. Compare the results statistically to determine if the performance differences, particularly in topology metrics (e.g., a notable increase from TopoNet's TOPll and TOPlt to that of TopoMLP), are significant.",
      "expected_outcome": "Based on previously reported results (see Tables 1 and 2), it is expected that TopoMLP will yield higher scores in DETl, DETt, TOPll, TOPlt, and OLS compared to STSU, VectorMapNet, MapTR, and TopoNet under identical experimental settings. The anticipated performance boost, especially in lane-lane topology metrics (with TOPll and TOPlt showing significant improvements), should confirm TopoMLP's superior capability in handling lane detection and topology reasoning tasks on the OpenLane-V2 dataset.",
