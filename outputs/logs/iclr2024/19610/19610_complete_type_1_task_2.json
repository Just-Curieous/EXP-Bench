      "hypothesis": "The incorporation of extra YOLOv8 proposals (as indicated by the '*' configurations) further boosts the performance of TopoMLP on OpenLane-V2 subset A, particularly improving the topology metrics (TOPll and TOPlt) and overall performance (OLS) by better handling small objects like traffic lights.",
      "method": "On OpenLane-V2 subset A, design an experiment comparing two variants of TopoMLP: one baseline using only the ResNet-50 backbone (TopoMLP) and one enhanced variant with integrated extra YOLOv8 proposals (TopoMLP*). Use a consistent image preprocessing pipeline where images are resized to 1550\u00d72048 and downsampled by a factor of 0.5. For both variants, set up the configuration with 300 lane queries and 4 control points per lane, and train each model for 24 epochs using identical training settings. Evaluate both models on detection metrics (DETl and DETt) and topology metrics (TOPll and TOPlt), and compute the overall lane score (OLS). Additionally, document the improvements in detection handling (such as an increase in true positive detections prior to unmatched false positives) and enhanced performance observed in topology-related metrics. Incorporate insights from Table 2 and Table 4, and note that enhanced predictions (as illustrated in Figure 5) facilitate a higher precision in assessing the topology reasoning.",
      "expected_outcome": "It is expected that the enhanced TopoMLP* model with extra YOLOv8 proposals will exhibit significant improvements over the baseline TopoMLP, particularly in topology performance (with higher TOPll and TOPlt scores) and overall performance (higher OLS). The enhanced proposal mechanism should also improve detection quality for small objects, thereby contributing to better true positive rates and overall performance as indicated by the performance gains observed in the paper.",
