    "no_answer": "After thoroughly exploring the repository, I could not find any existing scripts or configurations that specifically perform an ablation study on varying the number of control points (3, 4, 5) in the BÃ©zier curve representation. The repository contains a TopoMLP model implementation that uses 4 control points by default (as seen in all configuration files), but there are no ready-made scripts or configurations to compare different numbers of control points. While the code supports changing the number of control points through the 'method_para' parameter in the configuration files, there are no pre-configured experiments or scripts that directly answer the question about comparing 3, 4, and 5 control points and their impact on detection and topology metrics."
