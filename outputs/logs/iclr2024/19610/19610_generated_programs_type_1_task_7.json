    "usage_instructions": "To evaluate the impact of lane coordinate embedding and L1 loss for intersection point supervision on topology reasoning, you need to create three configuration variants and run the test script on each. \n\n1. First, create the three configuration variants:\n   - For the full model: Use the existing config at `/workspace/projects/configs/topomlp_setA_r50_wo_yolov8.py`\n   - For the 'w/o position' variant: Create a copy of the base config and modify the lane head by setting `with_position=False` (line 112)\n   - For the 'w/o L1 loss' variant: Create a copy of the base config and modify the TopoLLHead by setting `loss_ll_l1_weight=0` (line 175)\n\n2. Then run the test script on each variant with a pre-trained model checkpoint:\n   ```\n   ./tools/dist_test.sh /workspace/projects/configs/topomlp_setA_r50_wo_yolov8.py /path/to/checkpoint.pth 1 --eval=bbox\n   ```\n\n3. The test script will output the performance metrics including DETl, DETt, TOPll, TOPlt, and OLS, which can be compared to evaluate the impact of each component on topology reasoning performance."
