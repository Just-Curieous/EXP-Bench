Preprocess the images by resizing them to 1550\u00d72048 and applying a down-sampling ratio of 0.5. During training, use a consistent batch size (e.g., 8 on GPUs) and ensure that during inference, each model outputs at most 300 lanes. For each model, perform both lane and traffic element detection as well as lane-lane topology prediction. Compute the following metrics: (a) DETl and DETt, representing the mean average precision for lane detection (using Fr\u00e9chet distance thresholds for lane centerlines and IoU for traffic categories), (b) graph-based topology scores TOPll and TOPlt, which involve projecting the ground-truth graph onto the predicted graph using vertex matching (with edge confidence thresholds of 0.5), and (c) the overall OLS metric, defined as a square-root average of the individual metrics. Additionally, incorporate analysis parameters such as varying lane queries (e.g., 200, 300, 500) and control points settings to assess model robustness and the impact on performance. Compare the results statistically to determine if the performance differences, particularly in topology metrics (e.g., a notable increase from TopoNet's TOPll and TOPlt to that of TopoMLP), are significant.",
            "expected_outcome": "Based on previously reported results (see Tables 1 and 2), it is expected that TopoMLP will yield higher scores in DETl, DETt, TOPll, TOPlt, and OLS compared to STSU, VectorMapNet, MapTR, and TopoNet under identical experimental settings. The anticipated performance boost, especially in lane-lane topology metrics (with TOPll and TOPlt showing significant improvements), should confirm TopoMLP's superior capability in handling lane detection and topology reasoning tasks on the OpenLane-V2 dataset.",

Keep other parameters unchanged including the feature extraction settings, spatial region settings (e.g., X-axis within [\u221251.2m, 51.2m], Y-axis within [\u221225.6m, 25.6m], Z-axis within [\u22128m, 4m]), and training settings. Evaluate the performance based on the metrics DETl, DETt, TOPll, TOPlt, and OLS as previously reported. In particular, refer to the values in Table 3 (a): 200 queries yield DETl 28.2, DETt 49.9, TOPll 6.1, TOPlt 20.2, and OLS 36.9; 300 queries yield DETl 28.3, DETt 50.0, TOPll 7.2, TOPlt 22.8, and OLS 38.2; 500 queries yield DETl 27.9, DETt 49.6, TOPll 7.3, TOPlt 22.4, and OLS 38.0.

For each variant, measure the performance on lane detection and topology reasoning using the metrics DETl, DETt, TOPll, TOPlt, and OLS. In particular, pay close attention to the TOPll metric, which quantifies the lane-lane topology performance. Use the performance figures as documented in Table 3(c), where the full model achieves TOPll of 7.2 (with DETl of 28.3, DETt of 50.0, TOPlt of 22.8, and OLS of 38.2), the w/o position variant shows a decrease to a TOPll of 6.9 (with DETl of 27.9, DETt of 50.9, TOPlt of 21.6, and OLS of 37.9), and the w/o L1 loss variant further declines to a TOPll of 6.5 (with DETl of 26.6, DETt of 50.9, TOPlt of 22.1, and OLS of 37.5). This detailed experimental setup will enable a clear comparison of the effect of each component on overall topology reasoning performance.",

The experiment compares the performance with and without using YOLOv8 object detection proposals across different backbone architectures.\n\n1. Create a distributed testing script that:\n   - Takes a configuration file path, checkpoint path, and number of GPUs as inputs\n   - Sets up a PyTorch distributed environment\n   - Launches the test script with appropriate arguments\n\n2. Create configuration files for two backbone architectures:\n   - ResNet-50 backbone configuration\n   - Swin Transformer backbone configuration\n   - Both configurations should define the TopoMLP model architecture with lane detection head (lc_head), traffic element detection head (te_head), lane-to-lane topology head (lclc_head), and lane-to-traffic-element topology head (lcte_head)\n\n3. Implement the testing logic that:\n   - Loads the specified configuration and checkpoint\n   - Sets up distributed testing environment\n   - Builds the dataset and dataloader\n   - Runs inference on the model\n   - Evaluates the results using metrics including DET_l (lane detection), DET_t (traffic element detection), TOP_ll (lane-to-lane topology), TOP_lt (lane-to-traffic topology), and OLS (overall score)\n\n4. Support running experiments in two modes:\n   - Baseline mode: without external object proposals\n   - Enhanced mode: with YOLOv8 object detection proposals provided through configuration options\n\nThe goal is to compare the performance metrics between the baseline and enhanced modes across both backbone architectures to determine if YOLOv8 proposals improve the model's performance.",

Specifically, calculate the original TOP metric as defined by Equation (7) and the adjusted TOP (TOP\u2020) as defined by Equation (8). The adjusted metric uses an enhanced precision score (P(v)\u2020) that integrates a correction factor based on the ratio of true positives (NTP) to the sum of true positives and false positives (NTP + NFP). In addition to evaluating the overall TOP scores, record detailed metrics including DETl, DETt, TOPll, TOPlt, and OLS. Use Figure 5 as an illustrative reference to understand how enhanced prediction scores mitigate the negative influence of high confidence false positives by reordering true positives ahead of unmatched instances. Furthermore, relate your findings to the comparative performance results shown in Table 4, where the adjusted TOP metric improved topology evaluation for both TopoMLP and TopoNet. This comprehensive analysis will reveal how the adjusted metric stabilizes performance evaluation and offers a fairer representation of the topology quality.",
