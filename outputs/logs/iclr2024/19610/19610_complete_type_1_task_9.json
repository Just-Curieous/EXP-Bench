      "hypothesis": "Will modifying the representation in lane-traffic topology reasoning by integrating a view transformation matrix into the lane features, or by substituting rich traffic element features with only bounding boxes, affect the overall topology reasoning performance? Is there a trade-off between detailed traffic representation (including category information) and computational simplicity?",
      "method": "Conduct experiments on OpenLane-V2 subset A using three configurations for lane-traffic topology reasoning: (1) Baseline: use full lane and traffic features as described in the original setup; (2) Integrate a view transformation matrix into the lane representation (w/otransform) to examine its effect on the topology reasoning, targeting improvements such as the TOPlt metric increasing from 21.4 to 22.8; (3) Replace traffic features with only bounding boxes (wonly box), acknowledging that this approach might lose category-specific information, potentially reducing the TOPlt score (from 22.8 to 22.0). Use quantitative metrics including TOPlt, along with other metrics referenced in Table 3 (d) such as DETl, DETt, and TOPll, to thoroughly assess and compare the performance of each configuration. The analysis should include a discussion on the sufficiency of a single MLP network for high-performance topology reasoning.",
      "expected_outcome": "The integration of the view transformation matrix is expected to improve the TOPlt score (e.g., from 21.4 to around 22.8), while using only bounding boxes for traffic elements is anticipated to reduce performance (from 22.8 to roughly 22.0), thereby highlighting the importance of detailed and category-aware traffic feature representations in optimizing lane-traffic topology reasoning.",

      "usage_instructions": "To run the ablation study experiments for lane-traffic topology reasoning as described in Section 4.4 of the paper, follow these steps:\n\n1. First, ensure you have a trained checkpoint of the TopoMLP model.\n\n2. Edit the `/workspace/run_ablation_study.sh` script to specify the correct path to your checkpoint file and the number of GPUs to use.\n\n3. Run the script using: `bash /workspace/run_ablation_study.sh`\n\nThis will execute three experiments:\n- Baseline: Using full lane and traffic features with `add_pos=False` to disable the view transformation matrix\n- w_otransform: Integrating a view transformation matrix into the lane features by setting `add_pos=True`\n- wonly_box: Using the view transformation matrix while simplifying traffic element features to only use bounding boxes\n\nThe script will output evaluation metrics including TOPlt, DETl, DETt, and TOPll for each configuration, allowing you to compare the performance and analyze the trade-offs between detailed traffic representation and computational simplicity.",

      "agent_instructions": "Create a system to run an ablation study for lane-traffic topology reasoning with three different configurations of the TopoMLP model. The ablation study should compare the following configurations:\n\n1. Baseline: A configuration that uses full lane and traffic features but disables the view transformation matrix in the lane-traffic topology head (set add_pos=False).\n\n2. With View Transformation: A configuration that enables the view transformation matrix (set add_pos=True with pos_dimension=9) while using full lane and traffic features.\n\n3. Simplified Traffic Features: A configuration that enables the view transformation matrix (same as #2) but simplifies the traffic element features to only use bounding boxes (set simplified_features=True in the traffic element head).\n\nAll configurations should extend a base TopoMLP configuration with a ResNet-50 backbone. Create a script that runs all three experiments sequentially using a distributed testing tool, passing the appropriate configuration file, checkpoint path, and GPU count to each run. The script should output evaluation metrics including TOPlt, DETl, DETt, and TOPll for each configuration to allow comparison of performance trade-offs between detailed traffic representation and computational simplicity.",
