      "hypothesis": "Does incorporating YOLOv8 proposals for traffic detection improve detection performance across different backbones (specifically ResNet-50 and Swin-B) in the TopoMLP framework?",
      "method": "Set up experiments using the TopoMLP model on OpenLane-V2 subset A. Run two sets of experiments: one that integrates YOLOv8 proposals as traffic detection queries and one that does not. Ensure that the rest of the experimental setup is identical between the two settings, including image resizing to 1550 \u00d7 2048 followed by a 0.5 down-sampling, lane query number fixed at 300, and using 4 control points for lane detection. For traffic detection, adopt the feature pyramid derived from C3, C4, and C5 feature maps, and use the same loss weights as reported (classification weight of 1.5 and regression weight of 0.2). Evaluate traffic detection performance using the metrics reported in the paper (e.g., DET_l, DET_t, TOP_ll, TOP_lt, OLS) as seen in Table 1 (marked with '*'). Additionally, compare performance results across the two different backbones, ResNet-50 and Swin-B, to assess the contribution of YOLOv8 proposals to detection outcomes.",
      "expected_outcome": "The experiments should show that incorporating YOLOv8 proposals consistently improves traffic detection performance across both ResNet-50 and Swin-B backbones by increasing key metrics (such as DET_l and DET_t) relative to the baseline without YOLOv8. It is also expected that even without these proposals, the TopoMLP model will achieve competitive results compared to other methods, thereby validating the effectiveness and robustness of the model.",

      "agent_instructions": "Your task is to implement a distributed testing framework for evaluating a topological multi-layer perception (TopoMLP) model on autonomous driving perception tasks. The experiment compares the performance with and without using YOLOv8 object detection proposals across different backbone architectures.\n\n1. Create a distributed testing script that:\n   - Takes a configuration file path, checkpoint path, and number of GPUs as inputs\n   - Sets up a PyTorch distributed environment\n   - Launches the test script with appropriate arguments\n\n2. Create configuration files for two backbone architectures:\n   - ResNet-50 backbone configuration\n   - Swin Transformer backbone configuration\n   - Both configurations should define the TopoMLP model architecture with lane detection head (lc_head), traffic element detection head (te_head), lane-to-lane topology head (lclc_head), and lane-to-traffic-element topology head (lcte_head)\n\n3. Implement the testing logic that:\n   - Loads the specified configuration and checkpoint\n   - Sets up distributed testing environment\n   - Builds the dataset and dataloader\n   - Runs inference on the model\n   - Evaluates the results using metrics including DET_l (lane detection), DET_t (traffic element detection), TOP_ll (lane-to-lane topology), TOP_lt (lane-to-traffic topology), and OLS (overall score)\n\n4. Support running experiments in two modes:\n   - Baseline mode: without external object proposals\n   - Enhanced mode: with YOLOv8 object detection proposals provided through configuration options\n\nThe goal is to compare the performance metrics between the baseline and enhanced modes across both backbone architectures to determine if YOLOv8 proposals improve the model's performance.",
