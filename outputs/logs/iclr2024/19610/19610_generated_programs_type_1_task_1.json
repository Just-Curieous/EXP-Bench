    "usage_instructions": "To evaluate TopoMLP on OpenLane-V2 subset B with different backbones and configurations as described in the experiment question:\n\n1. For ResNet-50 backbone (24 epochs):\n   - Train: ./tools/dist_train.sh projects/configs/topomlp_setB_r50_wo_yolov8.py 8 --work-dir=./work_dirs/topomlp_setB_r50_wo_yolov8\n   - Test: ./tools/dist_test.sh projects/configs/topomlp_setB_r50_wo_yolov8.py ./work_dirs/topomlp_setB_r50_wo_yolov8/latest.pth 8 --eval=bbox\n\n2. For Swin-B or VOV backbones:\n   - Create a new config file by copying projects/configs/topomlp_setB_r50_wo_yolov8.py and replacing the img_backbone section with the corresponding backbone from projects/configs/topomlp_setA_swinb_wo_yolov8.py or projects/configs/topomlp_setA_vov_wo_yolov8.py\n   - Train and test using the same commands as above with the new config file\n\n3. For YOLOv8 proposals:\n   - Download YOLOv8 detection results from Google Drive (link in docs/setup.md)\n   - Modify the config file to set yolov8_file parameter to the path of the downloaded file in the data section\n\nThe evaluation metrics (DETl, DETt, TOPll, TOPlt, OLS) will be automatically computed during testing."
