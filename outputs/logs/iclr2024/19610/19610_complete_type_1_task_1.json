      "hypothesis": "TopoMLP, when evaluated on the OpenLane-V2 subset B with a 24-epoch training regimen and various configurations\u2014including different backbones (ResNet-50, VOV, Swin-B) and optionally enhanced with extra YOLOv8 proposals\u2014will consistently outperform state-of-the-art competitors (STSU, VectorMapNet, MapTR, TopoNet) on both perception (DETl, DETt) and topology (TOPll, TOPlt, OLS) metrics.",
      "method": "Conduct experiments on OpenLane-V2 subset B, which features 6 views per sample. Implement TopoMLP with multiple backbones: ResNet-50, VOV, and Swin-B. For each configuration, use a fixed training protocol of 24 epochs (with additional experiments at 48 epochs for extended analysis) and resize all images to 1550\u00d72048 with a down-sampling ratio of 0.5. Evaluate using metrics such as DETl, DETt, TOPll, TOPlt, and OLS. Run comparisons with state-of-the-art methods\u2014STSU, VectorMapNet, MapTR, and TopoNet\u2014using the same evaluation procedures. The experiment should involve: (1) performing the model training and detection on multi-view images; (2) extracting prediction outputs; (3) computing the mAP-like metrics for detection and topology analysis; (4) applying statistical tests to assess if the performance differences are significant; and (5) referencing detailed quantitative insights from Table 1 and Table 2\u2014such as improvements observed with the Swin-B backbone (e.g., DETl of ~32.3 and DETt of ~65.5) and topology gains (e.g., TOPll/TOPlt improvements with extra YOLOv8 proposals. Additionally, qualitative results from Figure 3 supporting correct lane detection and topology can also be considered.",
      "expected_outcome": "It is expected that TopoMLP will demonstrate significant improvements over competing methods. Based on reported results, TopoMLP should achieve higher detection and topology metrics, particularly with advanced backbones such as Swin-B and when integrated with extra YOLOv8 proposals. For example, improvements in topology metrics (e.g., TOPll increasing by over 7 points compared to TopoNet) and enhanced overall robustness across various network architectures are anticipated. These outcomes will underline the efficacy of TopoMLP in handling complex lane detection challenges and topology connectivity on the OpenLane-V2 dataset.",
