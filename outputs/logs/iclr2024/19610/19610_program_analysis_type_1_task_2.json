  "agent_instructions": "Your task is to implement scripts for training and evaluating a TopoMLP model for lane detection and traffic element recognition, with and without YOLOv8 proposals. You need to create three files:\n\n1. A distributed training script that:\n   - Takes a configuration file path, number of GPUs, and additional parameters as input\n   - Sets up a PyTorch distributed training environment\n   - Executes the training process with the specified parameters\n\n2. A distributed testing script that:\n   - Takes a configuration file path, checkpoint path, number of GPUs, and additional parameters as input\n   - Sets up a PyTorch distributed testing environment\n   - Executes the evaluation process with the specified parameters\n\n3. A configuration file for the TopoMLP model that:\n   - Defines a ResNet-50 backbone with FPN neck\n   - Configures specialized heads for lane detection (LaneHead) and traffic element recognition (TrafficHead)\n   - Includes topological heads for lane-lane (TopoLLHead) and lane-traffic element (TopoLTHead) relationships\n   - Sets up data processing pipelines for training and testing\n   - Configures dataset settings with a parameter for YOLOv8 detection file (set to None for baseline)\n   - Defines optimizer settings with AdamW and cosine annealing learning rate schedule\n   - Includes evaluation and logging configurations\n\nThe experiment involves comparing two versions of the model:\n1. A baseline TopoMLP model without YOLOv8 proposals\n2. An enhanced TopoMLP* model with YOLOv8 proposals\n\nThe difference between these versions is controlled by the 'yolov8_file' parameter in the dataset configuration, which should be None for the baseline and a path to YOLOv8 detection results for the enhanced version.\n\nThe workflow should allow for training both models, evaluating their performance, and comparing metrics to assess the impact of incorporating YOLOv8 proposals.",
