    "no_answer": "After thoroughly examining the repository, I couldn't find a specific script or set of scripts that directly answer the experiment question about comparing the original TOP metric with the adjusted TOP metric (TOPâ€ ) that incorporates a correctness factor. While the repository contains the implementation of TopoMLP and evaluation scripts for the OpenLane-V2 dataset, there doesn't appear to be a dedicated script for calculating both versions of the TOP metric and comparing them as described in the experiment question. The evaluation in this repository seems to use the standard TOP metric implementation from the OpenLane-V2 evaluation module, but doesn't include the specific adjustment described in the experiment question that would mitigate the impact of false positives by incorporating a correction factor based on the ratio of true positives to the sum of true positives and false positives."
