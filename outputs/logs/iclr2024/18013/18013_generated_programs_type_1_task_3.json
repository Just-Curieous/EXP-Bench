    "no_answer": "After thoroughly exploring the repository, I could not find specific scripts that directly answer the experiment question about comparing Llama-2, Llama-2 + MPT, and FuseLLM (Llama-2 + MPT + OpenLLaMA) on the BBH benchmark. The FuseLLM README mentions using external evaluation tools from open-instruct (https://github.com/allenai/open-instruct/tree/main/eval) for BBH evaluation, but there are no scripts in the repository that implement this specific comparison. The repository contains training scripts for FuseLLM and points to external evaluation tools rather than containing the evaluation scripts directly."
