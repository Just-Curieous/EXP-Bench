    "no_answer": "After a thorough search of the repository, I could not find specific scripts that directly answer the experiment question about comparing MinED (Minimum Edit Distance) and EM (Exact Matching) methods on the BBH benchmark. While the repository contains code for token alignment using editdistance in the FuseLLM project (specifically in /workspace/FuseLLM/src/utils/others.py and /workspace/FuseLLM/src/utils/vocab_mapping.py), there are no evaluation scripts that specifically compare these two alignment criteria on the BBH benchmark. The repository contains various evaluation scripts for other benchmarks, but none that directly address this specific experiment question."
