    "no_answer": "After thoroughly exploring the repository, I couldn't find a specific script that directly answers the experiment question about FuseLLM outperforming Llama-2 on MultiPL-E benchmarks in zero-shot settings. The FuseLLM README.md mentions that they used the external 'bigcode-evaluation-harness' repository for MultiPL-E evaluation (https://github.com/bigcode-project/bigcode-evaluation-harness), but this tool is not included in the repository itself. While there are code evaluation scripts in the FuseO1-Preview/code_evaluation directory, these are for LiveCodeBench, not specifically for MultiPL-E. To reproduce the experiment comparing FuseLLM with Llama-2 on MultiPL-E benchmarks, users would need to use the external evaluation tools mentioned in the README rather than scripts provided in this repository."
