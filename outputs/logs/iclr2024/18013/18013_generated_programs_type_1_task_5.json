    "no_answer": "After thoroughly examining the repository, I couldn't find a specific script or set of scripts that directly answer the question about comparing FUSELLM with MinCE vs AvgCE on the BBH benchmark. While the repository contains implementations of fusion functions (distill_greater_as_gt for MinCE and distill_weighted_as_gt for AvgCE) in the FuseLLM/src/utils/trainer.py file, and mentions BBH evaluation in the README, there isn't a dedicated script that performs this specific comparison. The repository references external evaluation tools for BBH (https://github.com/allenai/open-instruct/tree/main/eval) rather than containing the evaluation code directly."
