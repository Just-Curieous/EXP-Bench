    "no_answer": "After thoroughly searching the repository, I couldn't find specific scripts that directly answer the experiment question about comparing FuseLLM with Llama-2 on commonsense evaluations in zero-shot settings. The repository contains code for training FuseLLM and various evaluation frameworks, but according to the FuseLLM README.md, the commonsense evaluations (ARC-easy, ARC-challenge, BoolQ, HellaSwag, OpenBookQA) were performed using the external lm-evaluation-harness tool (version 0.3.0), which is referenced but not included in the repository. There are no scripts in the repository that specifically set up and run this comparison between FuseLLM and Llama-2 on the CommonSense benchmark in a zero-shot setting."
