    "no_answer": "The experiment described in the question, which compares a unit production-focused strategy with a city expansion strategy in full games, is not implemented in the current repository. According to the documentation, the tensor-based reinforcement learning agents are implemented in a separate repository called 'civrealm-tensor-baseline' (https://github.com/bigai-ai/civrealm-tensor-baseline), which is not included in this workspace. The current repository only provides the environment for the Freeciv-web game, but not the specific experiment scripts mentioned in the question."
