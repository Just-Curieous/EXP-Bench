    "no_answer": "After thoroughly exploring the repository, I found that this is the CivRealm repository which provides an environment for the Freeciv-web game. The LLM agents (Mastaba and BaseLang) mentioned in the experiment question are implemented in a separate repository called civrealm-llm-baseline. While the main.py file in that repository can be used to run either agent individually, there is no specific script or set of scripts in the current repository that directly answers the experiment question about comparing the hierarchical decision architecture (Mastaba) with the non-hierarchical one (BaseLang) across multiple maps and games. The experiment would require running multiple games with different maps and collecting detailed metrics, which is not implemented in any of the existing scripts."
