            "question": "Does the tensor-based RL model achieve higher success rates on minitasks with immediate rewards compared to those with sparse, delayed rewards?",
            "method": "Select a representative set of minitasks from the evaluation, clearly categorizing tasks into two groups: (1) tasks that provide explicit, immediate rewards (e.g., the 'CityTileWonder' minitask that has demonstrated \u223c90% success rate) and (2) tasks that provide sparse or delayed rewards, requiring longer-term strategic planning. For each task in both groups, train the tensor baseline model from scratch using the same architecture and training hyperparameters for 40,000 steps over 3 random seeds. Record the success rate for each training run. Additionally, analyze training curves and convergence trends as illustrated in Figure 6. Compute the average success rate and standard deviation for both groups, and perform a statistical analysis (e.g., a t-test or ANOVA) to determine if the observed differences are statistically significant. Incorporate summary statistics from Table 1 if applicable, and detail any observed trends or anomalies in performance across training steps.",
            "expected_outcome": "It is anticipated that minitasks offering immediate rewards will yield significantly higher success rates, as the tensor-based RL model benefits from clear and frequent feedback. In contrast, tasks with sparse, delayed rewards are expected to show markedly lower success rates due to the difficulty in aligning long-term strategic planning with reinforcement signals. The statistical analysis should confirm the significance of these differences, thereby validating the model's relative strengths and weaknesses as depicted in the experimental results (e.g., Figure 6).",

Run the experiment using the run.py script with the appropriate minitask configurations:\n   ```bash\n   cd /workspace/examples\n   python run.py --webdir /path/to/freeciv-web\n   ```\n   This will automatically run all minitasks defined in the run_configs directory with 3 random seeds for each, training for 40,000 steps as specified in the default configuration.\n\n3. After training is complete, use parse_tb.py to analyze and visualize the results:\n   ```bash\n   cd /workspace/examples\n   python parse_tb.py\n   ```\n   This will generate plots showing success rates and other metrics for each minitask type, allowing you to compare performance between immediate reward tasks and delayed reward tasks.\n\n4. The plots will be saved in the ./minitask directory, where you can examine the 'success rate' metric specifically to compare performance between the two groups of minitasks.\n\n5.

For each game, record detailed metrics such as population size, number of military units, overall game score, and extent of map expansion (e.g., area settled, with specific attention to turn milestones when significant expansion events occur). Additionally, document the impact of specific game-mechanic triggers (e.g., pirate invasions, diplomatic events) on each agent's performance. Supplement the quantitative metrics with timeline analyses by comparing progress at specified turns (for example, preliminary evaluations indicate that Mastaba may reach extensive map expansion by turn 113 compared to BaseLang\u2019s progress around turn 210). Moreover, consider and record in-game events and indicators as provided in Table 1 that outline performance metric benchmarks. Analyze the collected data using appropriate statistical tests (such as t-tests or ANOVA) to assess differences in performance across all measured outcomes. This refined setup leverages both the strategic overviews depicted in the figures and the structured metrics from the full game environment to comprehensively evaluate the benefits of a hierarchical decision architecture.",

            "method": "Using the same experimental setup as above, record not only the primary performance metrics but also the timing and consequences of game-mechanic triggers. For each game, log the following details using a data structure similar to that in Table 1 (with three columns: Game Score at Trigger, Trigger Turn, and Post-Trigger Survival Duration): (a) the game score at which the pirate invasion is triggered, (b) the turn number of the trigger, and (c) the number of additional turns (i.e., survival duration) played after the invasion. Additionally, record detailed metrics for phase transitions and common indicators, such as rewards, scores, success rate, policy loss, and value loss, as illustrated in Figures 18 to 24. Perform statistical correlation and survival analysis to compare the timing and severity of these invasions for both Mastaba and BaseLang. In particular, assess whether an earlier triggering of the pirate invasion correlates with a reduction in survival time, and determine if the hierarchical decision-making framework of Mastaba, which may rapidly increase scores and trigger events earlier, yields overall strategic gains at the expense of shorter sustained play post-event.",

However, even with a reduction in survival time post-trigger, the overall strategic performance and rapid expansion gains of Mastaba may validate its hierarchical decision framework. The trade-off between quick expansion and vulnerability to in-game penalties will be quantified using survival analysis and correlation statistics based on the logged metrics.",
