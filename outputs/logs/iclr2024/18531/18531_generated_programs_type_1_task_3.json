    "no_answer": "After thoroughly exploring the repository, I could not find any scripts that specifically address the experiment question about comparing the survival durations of hierarchical versus non-hierarchical agents when game mechanics like pirate invasions are triggered. While the repository contains code for both BaseLang (non-hierarchical) and Mastaba (hierarchical) agents, and there are evaluation mechanisms in the FreecivBaseEnv class that can track game scores, population, and other metrics, there are no scripts that specifically log or analyze the timing of pirate invasions, the game score at which they are triggered, or the post-trigger survival duration. The repository has general game evaluation capabilities through methods like evaluate_game(), plot_game_scores(), and get_game_results(), but these do not specifically track the metrics required for the experiment question about game mechanic triggers and their effects on different agent types."
