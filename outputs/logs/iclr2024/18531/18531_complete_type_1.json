      "question": "Does the tensor-based RL model achieve higher success rates on minitasks with immediate rewards compared to those with sparse, delayed rewards?",
      "method": "Select a representative set of minitasks from the evaluation, clearly categorizing tasks into two groups: (1) tasks that provide explicit, immediate rewards (e.g., the 'CityTileWonder' minitask that has demonstrated \u223c90% success rate) and (2) tasks that provide sparse or delayed rewards, requiring longer-term strategic planning. For each task in both groups, train the tensor baseline model from scratch using the same architecture and training hyperparameters for 40,000 steps over 3 random seeds. Record the success rate for each training run. Additionally, analyze training curves and convergence trends as illustrated in Figure 6. Compute the average success rate and standard deviation for both groups, and perform a statistical analysis (e.g., a t-test or ANOVA) to determine if the observed differences are statistically significant. Incorporate summary statistics from Table 1 if applicable, and detail any observed trends or anomalies in performance across training steps.",
      "expected_outcome": "It is anticipated that minitasks offering immediate rewards will yield significantly higher success rates, as the tensor-based RL model benefits from clear and frequent feedback. In contrast, tasks with sparse, delayed rewards are expected to show markedly lower success rates due to the difficulty in aligning long-term strategic planning with reinforcement signals. The statistical analysis should confirm the significance of these differences, thereby validating the model's relative strengths and weaknesses as depicted in the experimental results (e.g., Figure 6).",

First, identify the minitasks that provide immediate rewards (e.g., development_citytile_wonder) and those with sparse/delayed rewards (e.g., battle_* minitasks).\n\n2. Run the experiment using the run.py script with the appropriate minitask configurations:\n   ```bash\n   cd /workspace/examples\n   python run.py --webdir /path/to/freeciv-web\n   ```\n   This will automatically run all minitasks defined in the run_configs directory with 3 random seeds for each, training for 40,000 steps as specified in the default configuration.\n\n3. After training is complete, use parse_tb.py to analyze and visualize the results:\n   ```bash\n   cd /workspace/examples\n   python parse_tb.py\n   ```\n   This will generate plots showing success rates and other metrics for each minitask type, allowing you to compare performance between immediate reward tasks and delayed reward tasks.\n\n4. The plots will be saved in the ./minitask directory, where you can examine the 'success rate' metric specifically to compare performance between the two groups of minitasks.\n\n5.

      "question": "Does the current unit production-focused strategy in full games result in a myopic performance that achieves high immediate scores at the expense of long-term development? Can a modified reward scheme that adds a bonus for early city expansion\u2014despite an initial dip in population\u2014lead to improved overall game scores when considering multi-faceted metrics such as population, technology researched, and economic growth?",
      "method": "Conduct an experiment on the full game scenario under two experimental conditions as depicted in Figure 7. For the baseline condition, train the tensor RL model for 2 million steps using the original reward structure that heavily weights unit production. In the modified condition, adjust the reward configuration to incorporate a bonus for the early establishment of cities, aiming to stimulate long-term strategic planning even if it causes a short-term decline in population scores. Both conditions should use the same architecture, hyperparameters, and at least 3 random seeds to ensure robust and statistically significant comparisons. Record raw data on the overall game scores along with sub-metrics such as population, technology researched, and units built/killed over the training period. Analyze and compare the evolution of the overall scores and the detailed breakdown of game metrics using appropriate statistical methods to determine if the modified reward scheme effectively promotes exponential long-term growth.",
      "expected_outcome": "The baseline condition is expected to produce high immediate scores driven predominantly by unit production; however, it may lack long-term strategic growth. In contrast, the modified reward scheme is anticipated to eventually outperform the baseline by fostering early investment in city expansion, leading to exponential growth in population, technology, and economic metrics. This would validate that incentivizing early city expansion can mitigate the myopic tendencies of the original reinforcement learning strategy.",

      "question": "Does incorporating a hierarchical decision architecture improve strategic expansion and overall game performance in CivRealm?",
      "method": "Design an experiment comparing two language-based agents: one using a hierarchical decision architecture (Mastaba) and one relying on local observations without global oversight (BaseLang). Run 5 full games on each of 10 maps with distinct and diverse geographic features (including coastal, inland, and mixed terrains as illustrated in Figures 1 and 2). For each game, record detailed metrics such as population size, number of military units, overall game score, and extent of map expansion (e.g., area settled, with specific attention to turn milestones when significant expansion events occur). Additionally, document the impact of specific game-mechanic triggers (e.g., pirate invasions, diplomatic events) on each agent's performance. Supplement the quantitative metrics with timeline analyses by comparing progress at specified turns (for example, preliminary evaluations indicate that Mastaba may reach extensive map expansion by turn 113 compared to BaseLang\u2019s progress around turn 210). Moreover, consider and record in-game events and indicators as provided in Table 1 that outline performance metric benchmarks. Analyze the collected data using appropriate statistical tests (such as t-tests or ANOVA) to assess differences in performance across all measured outcomes. This refined setup leverages both the strategic overviews depicted in the figures and the structured metrics from the full game environment to comprehensively evaluate the benefits of a hierarchical decision architecture.",
      "expected_outcome": "It is expected that the hierarchical agent (Mastaba) will demonstrate significantly improved performance compared to BaseLang. Specifically, Mastaba should achieve a larger population, produce more military units, secure higher overall game scores, and exhibit faster map expansion. These findings would confirm that adopting a global perspective through a hierarchical decision architecture leads to improved strategic decisions and overall game performance in complex environments like CivRealm.",

The LLM agents (Mastaba and BaseLang) mentioned in the experiment question are implemented in a separate repository called civrealm-llm-baseline. While the main.py file in that repository can be used to run either agent individually, there is no specific script or set of scripts in the current repository that directly answers the experiment question about comparing the hierarchical decision architecture (Mastaba) with the non-hierarchical one (BaseLang) across multiple maps and games. The experiment would require running multiple games with different maps and collecting detailed metrics, which is not implemented in any of the existing scripts."

      "question": "Does the triggering of built-in game mechanics, such as pirate invasions when the score threshold is reached, affect the survival durations of hierarchical versus non-hierarchical agents?",
      "method": "Using the same experimental setup as above, record not only the primary performance metrics but also the timing and consequences of game-mechanic triggers. For each game, log the following details using a data structure similar to that in Table 1 (with three columns: Game Score at Trigger, Trigger Turn, and Post-Trigger Survival Duration): (a) the game score at which the pirate invasion is triggered, (b) the turn number of the trigger, and (c) the number of additional turns (i.e., survival duration) played after the invasion. Additionally, record detailed metrics for phase transitions and common indicators, such as rewards, scores, success rate, policy loss, and value loss, as illustrated in Figures 18 to 24. Perform statistical correlation and survival analysis to compare the timing and severity of these invasions for both Mastaba and BaseLang. In particular, assess whether an earlier triggering of the pirate invasion correlates with a reduction in survival time, and determine if the hierarchical decision-making framework of Mastaba, which may rapidly increase scores and trigger events earlier, yields overall strategic gains at the expense of shorter sustained play post-event.",
      "expected_outcome": "It is anticipated that Mastaba\u2019s hierarchical approach will lead to a rapid increase in game score and consequently earlier triggering of built-in game mechanics such as pirate invasions. This earlier triggering may lead to a shorter survival duration (i.e., fewer turns played after the invasion) compared to BaseLang. However, even with a reduction in survival time post-trigger, the overall strategic performance and rapid expansion gains of Mastaba may validate its hierarchical decision framework. The trade-off between quick expansion and vulnerability to in-game penalties will be quantified using survival analysis and correlation statistics based on the logged metrics.",

      "no_answer": "After thoroughly exploring the repository, I could not find any scripts that specifically address the experiment question about comparing the survival durations of hierarchical versus non-hierarchical agents when game mechanics like pirate invasions are triggered. While the repository contains code for both BaseLang (non-hierarchical) and Mastaba (hierarchical) agents, and there are evaluation mechanisms in the FreecivBaseEnv class that can track game scores, population, and other metrics, there are no scripts that specifically log or analyze the timing of pirate invasions, the game score at which they are triggered, or the post-trigger survival duration. The repository has general game evaluation capabilities through methods like evaluate_game(), plot_game_scores(), and get_game_results(), but these do not specifically track the metrics required for the experiment question about game mechanic triggers and their effects on different agent types."
