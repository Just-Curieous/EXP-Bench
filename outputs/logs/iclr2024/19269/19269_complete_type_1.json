      "hypothesis": "Does the choice of aggregation degrees in the LNAMD module affect the classification and segmentation performance on MVTec AD and VisA datasets, particularly considering that larger aggregation degrees may benefit the segmentation of large anomalies (as in MVTec AD) while smaller degrees may be more effective for small anomalies (as in VisA)?",
      "method": "Conduct an ablation study by varying the aggregation degree settings for the LNAMD module. Specifically, test the following configurations: {1}, {3}, {5}, {1,3}, {3,5}, and {1,3,5} on both the MVTec AD and VisA datasets. For each configuration, compute the image-level anomaly detection (AC) and pixel-level anomaly segmentation (AS) metrics, measured in AUROC percentages. Use the same pre-processing steps, backbone (ViT-L/14-336 pre-trained by OpenAI), and evaluation protocols as described in the paper. In addition to quantitative analysis, qualitatively review the segmentation outputs as displayed in Figures 11 to 16. Compare performance across configurations to not only determine the most effective aggregation degree setting but also to understand how aggregation degree impacts performance based on anomaly size\u2014anticipating that larger degrees work better on MVTec AD (which exhibits larger anomalies) and smaller degrees on VisA (characterized by smaller anomalies).",
      "expected_outcome": "Based on the results shown in Table 3 and related qualitative figures, the expected optimal configuration is {1,3,5}. This combination is anticipated to achieve an AC of approximately 97.8% and an AS of around 97.3% on MVTec AD, with comparable improvements on VisA (AC around 92.8% and AS near 98.7%). This would validate that combining multiple aggregation degrees enhances both classification and segmentation performance compared to using a single aggregation degree.",

All other experimental settings (e.g., using the same backbone, image resolution, and pre-processing steps) will remain unchanged. Moreover, incorporate an interval average operation on the minimum 30% of the anomaly scores in the MSM module to address the issue of normal patches with few similar matches. This operation, which is illustrated in Fig. 4 and Fig. 10, aims to reduce the influence of dissimilar patches in the scoring.",

Simultaneously, evaluate the anomaly detection metrics, specifically the AC (image-level anomaly detection) and AS (pixel-level anomaly segmentation) scores, on both the MVTec AD and VisA datasets as detailed in Table 7. Include comparison of the time and memory trade-offs alongside the observed minor variations in the performance metrics across the different subset configurations.",

The AC metric is anticipated to drop slightly (by less than 1.1%) while the AS metric will remain almost constant (down by at most 0.2%).
