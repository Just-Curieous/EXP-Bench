      "hypothesis": "Does the integration of the RsCIN module enhance the anomaly classification performance on industrial datasets?",
      "method": "Conduct controlled experiments to compare the performance of the MuSc model with and without the RsCIN module. Use the MVTec AD and VisA datasets to measure classification metrics such as AUROC, F1-max, and AP. Implement two sets of experiments: one with the RsCIN module enabled and one with it disabled, keeping all other parameters (e.g., backbone, pre-processing, and anomaly scoring modules) constant. Evaluate the performance differences with statistical significance if possible.",
      "expected_outcome": "Based on the findings in Table 5, the experiments with the RsCIN module are expected to show improved classification performance. For example, on MVTec AD, inclusion of RsCIN should elevate AUROC, F1-max, and AP scores compared to the configuration without it, thereby confirming its contribution to a more refined anomaly detection process.",

      "usage_instructions": "To test the impact of the RsCIN module on anomaly classification performance, you need to run the script twice with a minor modification to enable/disable RsCIN:\n\n1. First, run the script with RsCIN enabled (default setting):\n   ```\n   python examples/musc_main.py --device 0 --data_path ./data/mvtec_anomaly_detection/ --dataset_name mvtec_ad --class_name ALL --backbone_name ViT-L-14-336 --pretrained openai --feature_layers 5 11 17 23 --img_resize 518 --divide_num 1 --r_list 1 3 5 --batch_size 4 --output_dir ./output_with_rscin --save_excel True\n   ```\n\n2. Then, make a small modification to disable RsCIN by editing line 243-247 in /workspace/models/musc.py to set k_score=[0] (which disables RsCIN according to line 24-25 in _RsCIN.py):\n   ```\n   # Change from:\n   if self.dataset == 'visa':\n       k_score = [1, 8, 9]\n   elif self.dataset == 'mvtec_ad':\n       k_score = [1, 2, 3]\n   else:\n       k_score = [1, 2, 3]\n   \n   # To:\n   k_score = [0]  # Setting k_score to [0] disables RsCIN\n   ```\n\n3. Run the modified script with RsCIN disabled:\n   ```\n   python examples/musc_main.py --device 0 --data_path ./data/mvtec_anomaly_detection/ --dataset_name mvtec_ad --class_name ALL --backbone_name ViT-L-14-336 --pretrained openai --feature_layers 5 11 17 23 --img_resize 518 --divide_num 1 --r_list 1 3 5 --batch_size 4 --output_dir ./output_without_rscin --save_excel True\n   ```\n\n4. Repeat steps 1-3 for the VisA dataset by changing the dataset parameters:\n   ```\n   --data_path ./data/visa/ --dataset_name visa\n   ```\n\n5. Compare the classification metrics (AUROC, F1-max, AP) from the Excel files generated in the output directories to evaluate the impact of the RsCIN module.",

      "agent_instructions": "Create a script to evaluate the impact of the RsCIN (Robust Score Calibration with Image Neighborhood) module on anomaly detection performance. The script should:\n\n1.
