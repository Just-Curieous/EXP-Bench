            "method": "Conduct an ablation study by varying the aggregation degree settings for the LNAMD module. Specifically, test the following configurations: {1}, {3}, {5}, {1,3}, {3,5}, and {1,3,5} on both the MVTec AD and VisA datasets. For each configuration, compute the image-level anomaly detection (AC) and pixel-level anomaly segmentation (AS) metrics, measured in AUROC percentages. Use the same pre-processing steps, backbone (ViT-L/14-336 pre-trained by OpenAI), and evaluation protocols as described in the paper. In addition to quantitative analysis, qualitatively review the segmentation outputs as displayed in Figures 11 to 16. Compare performance across configurations to not only determine the most effective aggregation degree setting but also to understand how aggregation degree impacts performance based on anomaly size\u2014anticipating that larger degrees work better on MVTec AD (which exhibits larger anomalies) and smaller degrees on VisA (characterized by smaller anomalies).",
            "expected_outcome": "Based on the results and related qualitative figures, the expected optimal configuration is {1,3,5}. This combination is anticipated to achieve an AC of approximately 97.8% and an AS of around 97.3% on MVTec AD, with comparable improvements on VisA (AC around 92.8% and AS near 98.7%). This would validate that combining multiple aggregation degrees enhances both classification and segmentation performance compared to using a single aggregation degree.",

As seen in the experiment, larger aggregation degrees appear to work better on datasets like MVTec AD that exhibit larger anomalies, while smaller degrees are more effective for VisA with smaller anomalies. This inherent bias in the experimental configuration can lead to systematically skewed performance metrics, such as an expected AC of approximately 97.8% and AS around 97.3% on MVTec AD versus AC of around 92.8% and AS near 98.7% on VisA.",

For each strategy, compute the image-level AUROC (AC) and pixel-level AUROC (AS) on both the MVTec AD and VisA datasets. All other experimental settings (e.g., using the same backbone, image resolution, and pre-processing steps) will remain unchanged. Moreover, incorporate an interval average operation on the minimum 30% of the anomaly scores in the MSM module to address the issue of normal patches with few similar matches. This operation, which is illustrated in Fig. 4 and Fig. 10, aims to reduce the influence of dissimilar patches in the scoring.",

Moreover, it is anticipated that MuSc will report high classification AUROC values (e.g., around 97.8% for classification on MVTec AD) and perform robustly on segmentation tasks (e.g., achieving segmentation AUROC values of roughly 98.8%). Efficiency improvements are also expected, with reduced inference time and lower GPU memory usage when test images are processed in smaller subsets.

    "main_takeaways": [
        "The paper proposes the MuSc method (and its variant MuSc+) that achieves competitive anomaly segmentation and classification performance on benchmarks such as MVTec AD and VisA.",
        "Inference time and GPU memory cost can be significantly reduced by partitioning the dataset into multiple subsets (e.g., using s=3 reduces inference time to 513.5 ms and GPU cost to 5026 MB compared to s=1).",
        "The method shows robustness against inconsistent orientations and scales, outperforming existing methods like WinCLIP and APRIL-GAN in these settings, despite using a fixed pre-trained vision transformer that only performs minor data augmentations.",
        "The choice of configuration parameters, such as the proportion of the minimum value interval in MSM and the window mask sizes (with or without the RsCIN module), has a measurable impact on performance metrics (e.g., slight changes in AUROC, F1-max scores).",
        "Incorporating additional components like re-scoring with a constrained image-level neighborhood (RsCIN) and increasing the number of reference images can improve classification and segmentation results."
