      "hypothesis": "Does the inclusion of the RsCIN module, especially with a multi-window mask strategy, improve anomaly detection performance compared to using a single-window operation or no re-scoring with constrained image-level neighborhood?",
      "method": "Conduct controlled experiments by evaluating the MuSc method under different settings: (1) without the RsCIN module, (2) with the RsCIN module using a single-window mask strategy (using window sizes k \u2208 {2,...,9} and full-window k = \u221e), and (3) with the proposed multi-window mask strategy. Run these configurations on both MVTec AD and VisA datasets. Measure classification metrics (F1-max score, AUROC) and segmentation metrics (such as pixel-AUROC, PRO segmentation scores, and others provided in Table 17). Additionally, consider the effect of varying the number of reference images and dataset splits (as detailed in Table 7) and analyze the influence of different window mask sizes (refer to Figures 7 and 8). Compare improvements when integrating the RsCIN module in other AC/AS methods as discussed in Appendix A.2.4.",
      "expected_outcome": "The RsCIN module is expected to improve anomaly detection performance, demonstrating an approximate 0.9% gain in F1-max score on MVTec AD and a 2.8% AUROC gain on VisA. The multi-window strategy should further outperform the single-window mask operation and the configuration without RsCIN, with additional improvements in segmentation metrics such as pixel-AUROC and PRO segmentation scores, as supported by quantitative results in Tables 6, 7, and 17.",

      "usage_instructions": "To evaluate the impact of the RsCIN module with different window mask strategies on anomaly detection performance, you can run the musc_main.py script with different k_list parameters for the RsCIN module. The script already includes the RsCIN module implementation (in models/modules/_RsCIN.py) and uses it in the MuSc model (line 248 in models/musc.py).\n\nTo conduct the experiment:\n\n1. For testing without the RsCIN module, modify line 248 in models/musc.py to use k_list=[0] which bypasses the RsCIN module (as seen in line 24-25 of _RsCIN.py).\n\n2. For testing with a single-window mask strategy, modify line 243-247 in models/musc.py to use specific k values (e.g., k_score = [1, 2] for a single window size k=2).\n\n3. For testing with the multi-window mask strategy (default implementation), keep the existing configuration which uses multiple window sizes (k_score = [1, 2, 3] for MVTec AD and k_score = [1, 8, 9] for VisA).\n\nRun the script for each configuration on both MVTec AD and VisA datasets:\n\npython examples/musc_main.py --device 0 --data_path ./data/mvtec_anomaly_detection/ --dataset_name mvtec_ad --class_name ALL --backbone_name ViT-L-14-336 --pretrained openai --feature_layers 5 11 17 23 --img_resize 518 --divide_num 1 --r_list 1 3 5 --batch_size 4 --output_dir ./output --save_excel True\n\npython examples/musc_main.py --device 0 --data_path ./data/visa/ --dataset_name visa --class_name ALL --backbone_name ViT-L-14-336 --pretrained openai --feature_layers 5 11 17 23 --img_resize 518 --divide_num 1 --r_list 1 3 5 --batch_size 4 --output_dir ./output --save_excel True\n\nThe results will be saved in Excel files in the output directory, showing classification metrics (F1-max score, AUROC) and segmentation metrics (pixel-AUROC, PRO segmentation scores) for each configuration.",
