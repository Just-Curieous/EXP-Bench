      "hypothesis": "Does dividing the entire test dataset into smaller subsets (controlled by s) significantly reduce per-image inference time and GPU memory cost without notably compromising the AC and AS performance? Given the detailed results in Table 6 and Table 7, the experiment seeks to validate whether increasing s (i.e., creating smaller subsets per evaluation) leads to a decrease in computational resources (e.g., from 998.8 ms and 7168 MB at s=1 to 513.5 ms and 5026 MB at s=3) with only a minor degradation in detection performance (e.g., a drop in AC of less than 1.1% and a nearly invariant AS) on the MVTec AD and VisA datasets.",
      "method": "Divide the test images into different numbers of subsets (s = 1, 2, 3), following the division strategy reported in the original work. For each grouping, measure the per-image inference time and maximum GPU memory cost using an NVIDIA RTX 3090 GPU, referring to the values reported in Table 6. Simultaneously, evaluate the anomaly detection metrics, specifically the AC (image-level anomaly detection) and AS (pixel-level anomaly segmentation) scores, on both the MVTec AD and VisA datasets as detailed in Table 7. Include comparison of the time and memory trade-offs alongside the observed minor variations in the performance metrics across the different subset configurations.",
      "expected_outcome": "It is expected that increasing s will lead to a significant reduction in both inference time and GPU memory cost (e.g., decreasing from 998.8 ms and 7168 MB at s=1 to 513.5 ms and 5026 MB at s=3). The AC metric is anticipated to drop slightly (by less than 1.1%) while the AS metric will remain almost constant (down by at most 0.2%). This indicates that the efficiency gains in computation come at a minimal cost to overall detection performance.",
