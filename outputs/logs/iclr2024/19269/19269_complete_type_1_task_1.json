      "hypothesis": "Does the selection of different sample strategies in the MSM module influence the overall anomaly detection performance?",
      "method": "Perform an ablation study on the MSM module to assess the impact of various sample strategies on overall anomaly detection. The strategies include: (1) using the minimum anomaly score, (2) maximum anomaly score, (3) mean anomaly score, and (4) hybrid approaches such as '30% + min', '30% + max', and '30% + mean'. For each strategy, compute the image-level AUROC (AC) and pixel-level AUROC (AS) on both the MVTec AD and VisA datasets. All other experimental settings (e.g., using the same backbone, image resolution, and pre-processing steps) will remain unchanged. Moreover, incorporate an interval average operation on the minimum 30% of the anomaly scores in the MSM module to address the issue of normal patches with few similar matches. This operation, which is illustrated in Fig. 4 and Fig. 10, aims to reduce the influence of dissimilar patches in the scoring.",
      "expected_outcome": "According to Table 4 and supporting quantitative analyses, it is expected that the '30% + mean' strategy will yield superior performance. Specifically, the anticipated results are image-AUROC and pixel-AUROC values that match the best overall configuration (e.g., approximately 97.8% AC and 97.3% AS on MVTec AD, and around 92.8% AC and 98.7% AS on VisA). This would indicate that combining a minimum percentage (30%) with the mean statistic leads to a more robust anomaly score estimation compared to using single measures.",
