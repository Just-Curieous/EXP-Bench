    "no_answer": "After thoroughly examining the repository, I could not find any script or set of scripts that specifically compare the Zero-initialized attention method with CLIP, CoOP, CoCop, and MaPLe on the base-to-novel benchmark. While the repository contains code for LLaMA-Adapter which uses Zero-initialized attention, and includes evaluation code for other benchmarks like MME, there is no implementation or evaluation script specifically for the base-to-novel benchmark comparison mentioned in the question. The repository focuses on LLaMA-Adapter implementations and evaluations on different tasks, but not the specific comparative experiment described in the question."
