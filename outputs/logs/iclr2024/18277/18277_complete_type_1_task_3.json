      "question": "Will altering the number of layers (L) used for inserting adaptation prompts (try L = 10, 20, 30, 32) change the model performance?",
      "method": "1. **Problem Setup:** \n    - **Task:** \n    Perform an ablation study to assess the impact of varying the number of layers (L) on model performance when inserting adaptation prompts in a LLaMA model.\n    - **Objective:** \n    Determine the effect of layer count on answering accuracy, identifying an optimal L for adaptation prompt insertion.\n\n2. **Evaluation Metrics:**\n    - Answering accuracy measured on the ScienceQA validation set.\n3. **Comparative Evaluation:**\n    - Model: LLaMA-Adapter\n        - Insertion Layers L:\n            - L = 10\n            - L = 20\n            - L = 30\n            - L = 32\n\n4. **Settings for LLaMA-Adapter**:\n    - Fine tune LLaMA-Adapter on 8 A100 GPUs for 5 epochs.\n    - Warmup epochs:2\n    - Batch size:64\n    - Learning rate: 0.009\n    - Weight decay: 0.02\n    - Utilize the pre-trained LLaMA model with 7B parameters and N = 32 transformer layers\n    - Adopt a prompt length K = 10",
      "expected_outcome": "Increasing the layer numbers introduces more parameters, but leads to a large improvement in the answering accuracy of ScienceQA's validation set. There also exists an optimal insertion number from the higher layers, since too many layers would adversely disturb the early encoding of input words. It is expected that 30 to be the optimal number of layers.",

For instance, too many insertion layers might adversely disturb early feature encoding, while too few might not sufficiently modulate high-level information.

      "usage_instructions": "# LLaMA Adapter Fine-tuning Experiment\n\n## Prerequisites\n1. Install required dependencies: PyTorch, sentencepiece, and other necessary packages\n2. Download the LLaMA-7B model files and place them in a directory structure as follows:\n   - $TARGET_FOLDER/7B/consolidated.00.pth\n   - $TARGET_FOLDER/7B/params.json\n   - $TARGET_FOLDER/tokenizer.model\n3. Prepare the Alpaca instruction dataset (alpaca_data.json) with instruction-input-output format\n\n## Running the Experiment\nTo run the experiment with different numbers of layers (L) for inserting adaptation prompts, use the following command for each configuration:\n\n```bash\ntorchrun --nproc_per_node 8 /workspace/alpaca_finetuning_v1/finetuning.py \\\n    --model Llama7B_adapter \\\n    --llama_model_path $TARGET_FOLDER/ \\\n    --data_path $DATA_PATH/alpaca_data.json \\\n    --adapter_layer 10 \\\n    --adapter_len 10 \\\n    --max_seq_len 512 \\\n    --batch_size 4 \\\n    --epochs 5 \\\n    --warmup_epochs 2 \\\n    --blr 9e-3 \\\n    --weight_decay 0.02 \\\n    --output_dir ./checkpoint_L10/\n```\n\n## Experiment Variations\nRepeat the command for different adapter layer configurations by changing the following parameters:\n\n1. For L=10: `--adapter_layer 10 --output_dir ./checkpoint_L10/`\n2. For L=20: `--adapter_layer 20 --output_dir ./checkpoint_L20/`\n3. For L=30: `--adapter_layer 30 --output_dir ./checkpoint_L30/`\n4. For L=32: `--adapter_layer 32 --output_dir ./checkpoint_L32/`\n\n## Evaluation\nAfter training each model configuration, evaluate them on the ScienceQA validation set to measure answering accuracy. The paper's ablation study (Table 4) confirms that increasing the layer numbers from 10 to 30 leads to significant improvement in accuracy, with L = 30 being optimal.\n\n## Notes\n- The experiment uses distributed training across 8 GPUs\n- Each model is trained for 5 epochs with 2 warmup epochs\n- Only the adapter parameters are fine-tuned while the base LLaMA model parameters remain frozen\n- The adapter length is set to 10 for all configurations",
