    "no_answer": "After thoroughly searching the repository, I could not find any scripts or code that specifically compare Zero-initialized attention with Full, PT, and PT2 fine-tuning methods for RoBERTa on SQuAD v1.1 and v2.0 benchmarks. The repository primarily focuses on LLaMA-Adapter, which uses Zero-initialized attention for efficient fine-tuning of LLaMA models, but does not contain experiments with RoBERTa on SQuAD benchmarks as specified in the question. While the papers mention Zero-initialized attention as a technique, they don't include the specific comparison requested in the experiment question."
