    "no_answer": "After a thorough search of the repository, I couldn't find any specific scripts that directly compare zero-initialized attention to random-initialized attention on the ScienceQA validation set. The repository implements LLaMA-Adapter with zero-initialized attention (as seen in the model.py file where the gate parameter is initialized with zeros), but there doesn't appear to be a script that specifically compares this to random-initialized attention. While the README mentions ScienceQA as an application of the model, there are no evaluation scripts specifically for ScienceQA in the repository, nor are there scripts that modify the initialization to be random for comparison purposes."
