    "no_answer": "After thoroughly exploring the repository, I could not find any scripts that directly evaluate and compare LLaMA-Adapter with ChatGPT_CoT and GPT-4_CoT on the ScienceQA benchmark. While the paper (LLaMA-Adapter-arXiv.pdf) contains Table 2 on page 7 showing the comparison results between LLaMA-Adapter and other models including GPT-3 with Chain-of-Thought (CoT), the actual evaluation scripts for ScienceQA are not included in this repository. The repository contains evaluation scripts for other benchmarks (like MME in llama_adapter_v2_multimodal7b/util/evaluate_mme.py), but not specifically for ScienceQA."
