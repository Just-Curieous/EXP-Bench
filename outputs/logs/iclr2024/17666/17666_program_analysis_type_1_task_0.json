  "agent_instructions": "Create a script that implements a backdoor defense evaluation system for comparing different defense methods (BaDExpert, STRIP, Frequency, and SCALE-UP) against various backdoor attacks on image classification models.\n\nThe script should:\n\n1. Accept command-line arguments for:\n   - Dataset type (e.g., cifar10)\n   - Poison type (e.g., badnet, blend, trojan, etc.)\n   - Poison rate (e.g., 0.003)\n   - Defense method (BaDExpert, STRIP, Frequency, or ScaleUp)\n   - Other optional parameters like seed, device, etc.\n\n2. Implement the BaDExpert defense that:\n   - Loads a pretrained model that was trained on poisoned data\n   - Creates two expert models: an \"unlearned\" model trained to forget backdoor patterns and a \"shadow\" model finetuned on clean data\n   - Uses these models to detect backdoored inputs by analyzing prediction discrepancies\n   - Calculates metrics like AUROC, TPR, and FPR\n\n3. Implement the STRIP defense that:\n   - Detects backdoored inputs by superimposing test images with clean images\n   - Calculates entropy of predictions for these superimposed images\n   - Uses entropy distribution to distinguish between clean and backdoored inputs\n\n4. Implement the Frequency defense that:\n   - Converts images to frequency domain using DCT (Discrete Cosine Transform)\n   - Uses a CNN to analyze frequency patterns in clean vs. backdoored inputs\n   - Classifies inputs based on frequency domain characteristics\n\n5. Implement the SCALE-UP defense that:\n   - Scales up input images by different factors\n   - Analyzes prediction consistency across different scales\n   - Uses prediction consistency to identify backdoored inputs\n\n6. For each defense method, calculate and report:\n   - Clean Accuracy: accuracy on clean inputs\n   - ASR (Attack Success Rate): percentage of backdoored inputs that trigger the backdoor\n   - AUROC: area under ROC curve for backdoor detection\n   - TPR/FPR: true positive and false positive rates\n\nThe script should be designed to work with models trained on various backdoor attacks (badnet, blend, trojan, etc.) and should output metrics that can be used to compare the effectiveness of different defense methods.",
