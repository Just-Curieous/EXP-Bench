            "hypothesis": "BaDExpert outperforms baseline defenses in backdoor detection on CIFAR10, achieving significantly higher AUROC (near 99%), lower attack success rates (ASR, around 5.1%), and minimal clean accuracy (CA) drop (~0.9%) compared to baseline methods such as STRIP, Frequency, and SCALE-UP.",
            "method": "Utilize the CIFAR10 dataset and simulate 12 distinct backdoor attacks (including BadNet, Blend, Trojan, CL, SIG, Dynamic, ISSBA, WaNet, BPP, FT, TrojanNN, and SRA). Implement BaDExpert both as a post-development defense and as a backdoor input detector. For each attack, evaluate: (1) the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) on a noisy augmented validation set (to prevent overfitting), (2) the attack success rate (ASR) of the model with the defense, and (3) the drop in clean accuracy (CA) introduced by the defense. Run all experiments over at least three independent runs to report averaged metrics with corresponding standard deviations. Compare these results with those obtained from baseline defenses such as STRIP, Frequency, and SCALE-UP, as summarized in Tables 1 and 2. Additionally, perform ablation studies to understand the robustness of BaDExpert\u2019s key design components and, if possible, incorporate further evaluation insights from related figures and additional tables (e.g., Tables 3-6) mentioned in the source document.",
            "expected_outcome": "BaDExpert is expected to consistently achieve an average AUROC near 99% across the evaluated attacks, with the ASR dropping to approximately 5.1% and a minimal CA drop (around 0.9%). In contrast, baseline defenses are anticipated to display lower AUROC values (typically below 85%) along with less favorable ASR and CA trade-offs. The low standard deviations across multiple runs will indicate the robust and reliable performance of BaDExpert.",

            "hypothesis": "The size of the reserved clean set (Dc) affects BaDExpert's backdoor detection performance, with performance remaining robust (AUROC >98%) for moderately sized sets but potentially degrading when the number of clean samples is extremely limited.",
            "method": "Conduct a detailed ablation study by varying the reserved clean set size from 200 to 1800 samples, considering that the default is 2000 samples (roughly 5% of the training data). For a fixed attack type, such as the Blend attack on CIFAR10, run BaDExpert and record the AUROC for each Dc size. Plot the AUROC against the different Dc sizes with clear annotations marking performance trends. Additionally, compare these results against other detectors like SCALE-UP and STRIP under identical conditions to evaluate relative robustness. Include references to Table 1 (which provides results on post-development defense performance) and Table 2 (which details backdoor input detection metrics) to supplement the analysis.",
            "expected_outcome": "It is anticipated that BaDExpert will exhibit AUROC values above 98% for most settings with moderately sized clean sets, but for extremely limited clean sets (e.g., 200 or 400 samples), the AUROC may drop to around 95% or even lower (near 90%). Despite this, BaDExpert is expected to outperform the compared baselines (SCALE-UP and STRIP) under these constrained data conditions, supporting its overall robustness.",

        {
            "hypothesis": "Ensembling the outputs of the backdoor expert (B) and the auxiliary model M\u2032, using an exact ensembling decision rule, yields significantly higher detection performance (AUROC) compared to using either B or M\u2032 in isolation\u2014especially in scenarios where the reserved clean set is limited. This is based on observations that while each individual model sustains high AUROC (>95%) when ample clean data is available, their performance diverges as clean sample sizes decrease, with the ensemble consistently approximating or exceeding 99% AUROC.",
            "method": "Design an experiment on CIFAR10 under a specific backdoor attack scenario (e.g., the Blend attack) by testing three configurations: (a) using only the backdoor expert B, (b) using only the fine-tuned auxiliary model M\u2032, and (c) using an ensemble of both B and M\u2032. For each configuration, vary the reserved clean set size with values such as 200, 400, 1000, and 2000 samples. Follow these steps: 1) Implement each configuration with the exact ensembling decision rule as described in the source (refer to Sec B.2), 2) Run multiple trials for statistical significance, 3) Measure and record the AUROC for backdoor input detection in each case, 4) Compare performance against baseline models (as detailed in Table 8) to analyze if and how the ensemble approach mitigates the degradation seen in M\u2032 when clean samples are limited.",
            "expected_outcome": "It is expected that while both the backdoor expert B and the auxiliary model M\u2032 alone maintain high AUROC (above 95%) under sufficient clean data, the ensemble method will outperform each component individually\u2014especially as the size of the reserved clean set decreases\u2014by nearly achieving perfect detection (AUROC approaching or exceeding 99%). This outcome would validate that the ensemble approach effectively compensates for the limitations of individual models when clean data is scarce, as supported by the paper\u2019s analysis (see Fig. 5 and Table 8).",

            "hypothesis": "BaDExpert generalizes well and scales effectively to larger datasets such as ImageNet and across multiple model architectures, maintaining near-perfect detection performance with negligible CA drop.",
            "method": "Replicate the experimental setup on ImageNet by evaluating BaDExpert on various model architectures including ResNet18, ResNet101, and ViT-B/16 (with the possibility of additional architectures like VGG and MobileNetV2 for broader validation). For each configuration, implement different types of backdoor attacks including poisoning attacks (e.g., BadNet and Blend), trojaning attacks (e.g., TrojanNN), subnet-replacement attacks (SRA), and finetuning-based attacks. Reserve a small portion of clean samples (approximately 0.5% of ImageNet\u2019s training dataset) to create a noise-augmented validation set, following prior work (e.g., Guo et al., 2023) to avoid overfitting when calculating AUROC. Evaluate the defense performance comprehensively using metrics such as AUROC, ASR, and Clean Accuracy (CA). Average the results over three runs and report the standard deviations. Consolidate the detailed experimental results in tables\u2014comparable to the document\u2019s Table 1, Table 2, and Table 6\u2014and include corresponding figures for visual analysis.",
            "expected_outcome": "The expectation is that BaDExpert will achieve nearly 100% AUROC in detecting backdoor inputs, maintain an ASR of less than 5%, and only incur a minimal drop in CA (around 0.1%), thereby confirming its scalability and robust performance across different large-scale models and various types of adaptive backdoor attacks.",

            "hypothesis": "Does BaDExpert\u2019s detection performance (AUROC and ASR) significantly degrade when subjected to adaptive backdoor attacks that deliberately entangle the backdoor functionality with the normal functionality?",
            "method": "Replicate the experimental setup described in Section 4.4 (Resistance to Adaptive Attacks) using a standard backdoor dataset such as CIFAR10. Implement the following adaptive attack scenarios: TaCT, Adap-Blend, Adap-Patch, the All-to-All attack scenario, and the Natural Backdoor attack where the triggers are learned unconsciously. For each attack, perform the following steps: 1) Generate attacked inputs by applying the specified poisoning strategies designed to force dependencies between backdoor and normal predictions. 2) Deploy the BaDExpert defense system on these generated inputs and record both the AUROC and ASR values. Also, capture auxiliary statistics such as standard deviations (referencing the results in Tables 16-19) to assess variability. 3) Compare the obtained AUROC and ASR against the baseline performance of BaDExpert (with the reported average AUROC of ~99% on standard non-adaptive scenarios) and evaluate the extent of degradation; for instance, note that certain attacks may reduce the AUROC to around 87.0% or even lower in extreme cases. 4) Conduct thorough statistical analysis (e.g., significance testing) to determine if the observed differences are statistically significant. When available, reference additional results from related tables (such as Table 6 for baseline results on related datasets) to contextualize the outputs.",
            "expected_outcome": "It is expected that while the AUROC may degrade under adaptive attacks (e.g., dropping to around 87.0% for the BaDExpert-Adap-BadNet attack and potentially lower for other adaptive variants such as Adap-Blend), BaDExpert should still exhibit considerable resilience with detection performance remaining relatively robust. The ASR should remain low, confirming that even under tailored adaptive conditions, the degradation is limited and the defense retains its effectiveness. Statistical analysis is anticipated to confirm that the performance drop is significant compared to baseline yet remains within acceptable bounds.",

            "method": "Design an experiment that mirrors the adaptive attack settings described in Section 4.4 and Table 5. 1) Prepare a controlled subset of the backdoor dataset and generate adversarial examples using two types of modified triggers: (a) low-opacity triggers created by blending backdoor patterns with normal images at a reduced opacity level, and (b) optimized asymmetric triggers as in the BaDExpert-Adap-BadNet attack that minimizes the activation of the backdoor expert model. 2) Run these adversarial examples through the BaDExpert detection pipeline, ensuring that the model configuration and experimental setup follow the protocols used in prior experiments (e.g., those leading to the results in Table 2 and Table 5). 3) Record the key performance metrics\u2014Attack Success Rate (ASR) and Area Under the ROC Curve (AUROC)\u2014for each modified trigger condition. 4) Compare these metrics against scenarios using standard triggers. 5) Use the results, such as the observed AUROC values (~98.4% for low-opacity triggers and ~87.0% for the BaDExpert-Adap-BadNet attack) along with corresponding ASR values, to assess the degradation in detection performance and quantify the resilience of BaDExpert under these adaptive conditions.",
            "expected_outcome": "Based on the reported results, it is expected that introducing low-opacity triggers will cause a slight degradation in detection performance, with AUROC values observed around 98.4% and a modified ASR compared to standard triggers. In contrast, the tailored BaDExpert-Adap-BadNet attack is anticipated to result in a more pronounced degradation, with AUROC dropping to approximately 87.0%. Despite these reductions, BaDExpert should still maintain considerable effectiveness in detecting backdoor inputs when compared to non-adaptive attacks, thereby demonstrating its resilience even under targeted trigger perturbations.",
