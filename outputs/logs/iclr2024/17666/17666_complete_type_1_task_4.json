      "hypothesis": "Does BaDExpert\u2019s detection performance (AUROC and ASR) significantly degrade when subjected to adaptive backdoor attacks that deliberately entangle the backdoor functionality with the normal functionality?",
      "method": "Replicate the experimental setup described in Section 4.4 (Resistance to Adaptive Attacks) using a standard backdoor dataset such as CIFAR10. Implement the following adaptive attack scenarios: TaCT, Adap-Blend, Adap-Patch, the All-to-All attack scenario, and the Natural Backdoor attack where the triggers are learned unconsciously. For each attack, perform the following steps: 1) Generate attacked inputs by applying the specified poisoning strategies designed to force dependencies between backdoor and normal predictions. 2) Deploy the BaDExpert defense system on these generated inputs and record both the AUROC and ASR values. Also, capture auxiliary statistics such as standard deviations (referencing the results in Tables 16-19) to assess variability. 3) Compare the obtained AUROC and ASR against the baseline performance of BaDExpert (with the reported average AUROC of ~99% on standard non-adaptive scenarios) and evaluate the extent of degradation; for instance, note that certain attacks may reduce the AUROC to around 87.0% or even lower in extreme cases. 4) Conduct thorough statistical analysis (e.g., significance testing) to determine if the observed differences are statistically significant. When available, reference additional results from related tables (such as Table 6 for baseline results on related datasets) to contextualize the outputs.",
      "expected_outcome": "It is expected that while the AUROC may degrade under adaptive attacks (e.g., dropping to around 87.0% for the BaDExpert-Adap-BadNet attack and potentially lower for other adaptive variants such as Adap-Blend), BaDExpert should still exhibit considerable resilience with detection performance remaining relatively robust. The ASR should remain low, confirming that even under tailored adaptive conditions, the degradation is limited and the defense retains its effectiveness. Statistical analysis is anticipated to confirm that the performance drop is significant compared to baseline yet remains within acceptable bounds.",
