      "hypothesis": "BaDExpert outperforms baseline defenses in backdoor detection on CIFAR10, achieving significantly higher AUROC (near 99%), lower attack success rates (ASR, around 5.1%), and minimal clean accuracy (CA) drop (~0.9%) compared to baseline methods such as STRIP, Frequency, and SCALE-UP.",
      "method": "Utilize the CIFAR10 dataset and simulate 12 distinct backdoor attacks (including BadNet, Blend, Trojan, CL, SIG, Dynamic, ISSBA, WaNet, BPP, FT, TrojanNN, and SRA). Implement BaDExpert both as a post-development defense and as a backdoor input detector. For each attack, evaluate: (1) the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) on a noisy augmented validation set (to prevent overfitting), (2) the attack success rate (ASR) of the model with the defense, and (3) the drop in clean accuracy (CA) introduced by the defense. Run all experiments over at least three independent runs to report averaged metrics with corresponding standard deviations. Compare these results with those obtained from baseline defenses such as STRIP, Frequency, and SCALE-UP, as summarized in Tables 1 and 2. Additionally, perform ablation studies to understand the robustness of BaDExpert\u2019s key design components and, if possible, incorporate further evaluation insights from related figures and additional tables (e.g., Tables 3-6) mentioned in the source document.",
      "expected_outcome": "BaDExpert is expected to consistently achieve an average AUROC near 99% across the evaluated attacks, with the ASR dropping to approximately 5.1% and a minimal CA drop (around 0.9%). In contrast, baseline defenses are anticipated to display lower AUROC values (typically below 85%) along with less favorable ASR and CA trade-offs. The low standard deviations across multiple runs will indicate the robust and reliable performance of BaDExpert.",
