      "hypothesis": "Does the integration of the chemical feedback mechanism in MOLGEN facilitate significant property optimization and mitigate molecular hallucinations compared to a configuration without chemical feedback?",
      "method": "Perform an ablation study on MOLGEN by using two configurations: one with chemical feedback enabled and one without. Use a mixed batch of molecules from both natural products and synthetic compound domains. Steps include: (a) Generate a set of molecules using the version without chemical feedback to establish a baseline property score; (b) Generate molecules with the chemical feedback mechanism activated; (c) Compute and compare property scores (e.g., p-logP and QED) for both groups; (d) Visualize the distribution shifts in property scores (using plots similar to those in Figure 7 and detailed analysis in Appendix H.2); (e) Statistically test the significance of the shift in property scores. All experimental settings (dataset, training parameters) should be consistent with those mentioned in the paper.",
      "expected_outcome": "It is expected that the configuration with chemical feedback will yield increased property scores from the initial to the concluding groups, indicating that the feedback provides an effective guiding signal and reduces instances of molecular hallucinations.",

      "usage_instructions": "To perform the ablation study comparing MOLGEN with and without chemical feedback:\n\n1. First, generate molecules WITHOUT chemical feedback by modifying generate.sh to use the pre-trained model:\n   - Change the checkpoint_path to '../moldata/checkpoint/molgen.pkl'\n   - Set property to either 'plogp' or 'qed'\n   - Set a descriptive output path like '../moldata/generate/without_feedback_plogp.csv'\n   - Run: bash generate.sh\n\n2. Then, generate molecules WITH chemical feedback by modifying generate.sh to use the fine-tuned model:\n   - Change the checkpoint_path to '../moldata/checkpoint/syn_plogp_model.pkl' (for p-logP) or '../moldata/checkpoint/syn_qed_model.pkl' (for QED)\n   - Keep the same property setting as step 1\n   - Set a different output path like '../moldata/generate/with_feedback_plogp.csv'\n   - Run: bash generate.sh\n\n3. The script will automatically compute and compare property scores (p-logP or QED) for both configurations and output statistics in the logs.\n\nNote: Use a mixed batch of molecules from both natural products and synthetic compound domains by setting appropriate input_path values in generate.sh.",
