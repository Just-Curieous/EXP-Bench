      "hypothesis": "Incorporating the chemical feedback mechanism, which leverages properties such as p-logP, QED, and binding affinity, directly improves the generation of molecules with superior chemical properties and reduces molecular hallucinations in targeted molecule discovery tasks. We hypothesize that embedding this feedback loop will better align molecule generation with real-world distributions, preserving structural diversity (e.g., avoiding over-representation of ultra-long carbon chains) while enhancing property scores.",
      "method": "\u2022 Utilize a two-stage approach: pre-train on >100M molecules from the ZINC-15 dataset (molecules with molecular weight \u2264500 Daltons and LogP \u22645) and fine-tune on a synthetic dataset of 2.22M molecules spanning synthetic and natural product domains.  \u2022 Apply the chemical feedback paradigm during molecule generation on the synthetic dataset.  \u2022 Generate molecules optimized for high p-logP and QED properties, recording the top-3 property scores and comparing with baseline results as reported in Table 2.  \u2022 Assess binding affinities for two human protein targets, ESR1 and ACAA1, using AutoDockGPU to produce detailed docking simulation outputs; compare the optimized scores with those from leading baselines (see Table 3).  \u2022 Conduct pre- and post-optimization analysis on 1,000 molecules with initially low binding affinities for each target, visualizing improvements as illustrated in Figure 4.  \u2022 Additionally, evaluate structural diversity by examining features such as the occurrence of ultra-long carbon chains in high p-logP molecules.",
      "expected_outcome": "The experiment should demonstrate that MOLGEN, aided by the chemical feedback mechanism, is capable of generating molecules with exceptionally high p-logP scores (e.g., up to 80.30) while maintaining or surpassing QED performance relative to baselines (as detailed in Table 2). Furthermore, for binding affinity tasks the method is expected to achieve markedly lower KD values, with significant relative improvements (approximately 96.7% for ESR1 and 70.4% for ACAA1), thereby confirming its effectiveness in mitigating molecular hallucinations. Visualized improvements in binding affinities (Figure 4) alongside maintained molecular diversity will further substantiate the model's enhanced capabilities.",

      "usage_instructions": "To reproduce the experiment results from the paper:\n\n1. First, run the preprocess.sh script to generate candidate molecules using the pre-trained model. Modify the script to specify the appropriate property (plogp, qed, or binding_affinity) and dataset paths:\n   ```bash\n   cd /workspace/MolGen\n   # Modify preprocess.sh to set --property to 'plogp', 'qed', or 'binding_affinity'\n   # For binding affinity tasks, you'll need to provide the protein file path with --protein_path\n   bash preprocess.sh\n   ```\n\n2. Next, run the finetune.sh script to apply the chemical feedback paradigm during molecule generation:\n   ```bash\n   # Modify finetune.sh to set the appropriate checkpoint_path and finetune_path\n   bash finetune.sh\n   ```\n\n3. Finally, run the generate.sh script to generate optimized molecules and evaluate their properties:\n   ```bash\n   # Modify generate.sh to set the appropriate property (plogp, qed, or binding_affinity)\n   # For binding affinity tasks with ESR1 and ACAA1 targets, set --property to 'binding_affinity' and provide the protein file path\n   bash generate.sh\n   ```\n\nThe scripts will automatically calculate and report the top-3 property scores for p-logP, QED, or binding affinity as shown in Tables 2 and 3 of the paper. For binding affinity tasks, the script uses AutoDockGPU to perform docking simulations against the specified protein targets.",

      "agent_instructions": "Your task is to implement three shell scripts for a molecular generation pipeline that optimizes molecules for specific properties (plogp, qed, or binding_affinity). The pipeline consists of three stages:\n\n1. Preprocessing Stage:\n   - Create a script that uses DeepSpeed to generate candidate molecules from a pre-trained model\n   - The script should support configuring the target property (plogp, qed, or binding_affinity)\n   - For binding affinity tasks, it should accept a protein file path\n   - The script should use appropriate sampling parameters (top-k, beam search) for molecule generation\n   - Output should be saved as candidate molecules for the next stage\n\n2. Finetuning Stage:\n   - Create a script that finetunes the model using the candidates generated in the previous stage\n   - The script should implement a chemical feedback paradigm during molecule generation\n   - Configure appropriate loss weights for the training process\n   - Use DeepSpeed for distributed training\n   - Save the finetuned model for the next stage\n\n3. Generation Stage:\n   - Create a script that generates optimized molecules using the finetuned model\n   - The script should support the same properties as the preprocessing stage\n   - For binding affinity tasks with protein targets, it should accept a protein file path\n   - Configure appropriate generation parameters for diverse molecule generation\n   - The script should evaluate and report the top-3 property scores for the generated molecules\n\nThe scripts should work together to reproduce the experiment results from the paper, focusing on optimizing molecules for p-logP, QED, or binding affinity as shown in Tables 2 and 3 of the paper.",
