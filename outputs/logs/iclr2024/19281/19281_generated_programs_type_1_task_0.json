    "no_answer": "After thoroughly examining the repository, I couldn't find a specific script or set of scripts that directly answer the experiment question about evaluating MOLGEN's ability to capture real-world molecular distributions using the seven metrics mentioned (Validity, Fragment, Scaffold, SNN, IntDiv, FCD, and Novelty). While the repository contains code for generating molecules using the MOLGEN model (generate_ds.py and generate.sh), it doesn't appear to have a dedicated script for evaluating the generated molecules using these specific metrics. The repository imports the 'moses' library, which likely contains the evaluation metrics mentioned, but there's no script that explicitly uses these metrics to evaluate the generated molecules as described in the experiment question."
