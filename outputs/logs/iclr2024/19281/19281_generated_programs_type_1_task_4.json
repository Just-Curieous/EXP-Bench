    "no_answer": "While the repository contains scripts for generating molecules using MOLGEN and calculating various molecular properties (p-logP, QED, atom counts, etc.), there is no specific script or set of scripts that directly answers the experiment question about comparing molecular property distributions between MOLGEN and other generative models (GRAPH-based, VAE-based, SMILES-based PLMs). The generate_ds.py script can generate molecules and calculate properties, but it doesn't include functionality for creating distribution histograms, calculating KL-divergence between distributions, or comparing against other models. The repository provides the core functionality for molecule generation and property calculation, but additional code would need to be written to perform the specific distribution comparison analysis described in the experiment question."
