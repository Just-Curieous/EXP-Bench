  "agent_instructions": "Create a Python program that generates molecules with specific property constraints using the MolGen framework. The program should perform the following tasks:\n\n1. Import necessary libraries for molecular manipulation (RDKit), data processing, and visualization.\n\n2. Create functions to calculate key molecular properties:\n   - Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness (QED)\n   - Molecular Weight (MW)\n   - Octanol-water partition coefficient (logP)\n   - Lipinski's Rule of Five violations\n\n3. Load a dataset of molecules from the ZINC dataset.\n\n4. Filter the molecules based on drug-like property constraints:\n   - QED score greater than 0.6\n   - Molecular weight less than 450\n   - LogP value between 1 and 4.5\n   - No Lipinski Rule violations\n\n5. Select a subset of molecules from the filtered set to use as seed molecules.\n\n6. For each seed molecule:\n   - Calculate Morgan fingerprints to enable molecular similarity comparisons\n   - Find similar molecules with better properties (particularly higher QED scores)\n   - Calculate Tanimoto similarity between the seed and generated molecules\n\n7. Calculate and display comprehensive properties for both seed and generated molecules:\n   - QED score\n   - Molecular weight\n   - LogP value\n   - Number of Lipinski violations\n   - Similarity score (for generated molecules)\n\n8. Generate 2D visualizations of both seed molecules and their generated counterparts.\n\n9. Display the results in a clear format showing all calculated properties and similarity scores.\n\n10. Save the results to CSV files for further analysis.\n\nThe goal is to demonstrate how the MolGen framework can be used to identify molecules with improved drug-like properties while maintaining structural similarity to known compounds."
