            "expected_outcome": "MOLGEN is expected to achieve near-perfect validity (approximately 1.000) while outperforming competing models in capturing the fragment and scaffold distributions.

Additional analyses are expected to confirm that the generated molecules possess structural properties (in terms of atom counts, ring counts, molecular weights, and Bertz complexity) consistently aligned with the reference distributions, particularly excelling in the natural product domain.",

While the repository contains code for generating molecules using the MOLGEN model (generate_ds.py and generate.sh), it doesn't appear to have a dedicated script for evaluating the generated molecules using these specific metrics. The repository imports the 'moses' library, which likely contains the evaluation metrics mentioned, but there's no script that explicitly uses these metrics to evaluate the generated molecules as described in the experiment question.",

Instead of dropping only tokens deemed unimportant\u2014as is standard for reducing pre-training costs\u2014the procedure involves randomly dropping tokens. This random alteration introduces instability in gradient updates and can lead to inconsistent prediction accuracy in capturing complex molecular properties such as p-logP, QED, atom counts, ring counts, molecular weights, and Bertz complexity. Such unpredictable effects can be observed in the variability of property distributions shown in Figures 1\u20133 and Figure 6, as well as influences seen in quantitative measures like KL-divergence.",

For example, if the synthetic MOSES dataset is altered in a one-time pre-processing step (such as applying a uniform filtering criterion that skews properties like molecular weight or LogP, similar to the sentiment analysis example in the context) it leads to a persistent bias in the training data. This bias can systematically shift the baseline of property distributions, affecting downstream comparisons. In particular, MOLGEN's reported superiority in matching training distributions (as evidenced by the detailed histograms in Appendix Figures 1\u20133 and quantitative metrics like KL-divergence) could be artificially inflated by such systematic biases.",

These steps involve implementing the novel contribution of the paper, which is the MolGen model with chemical feedback.
