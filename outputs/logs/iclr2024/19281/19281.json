            "hypothesis": "MOLGEN accurately captures real-world molecular distributions, generating molecules that are not only valid but also structurally diverse and reflective of the reference distributions across both synthetic and natural product domains. This includes replicating complex substructure distributions and key chemical properties as indicated by high SNN scores and low FCD values.",
            "method": "\u2022 Generate 10,000 synthetic molecules and 80,000 natural product molecules using the pre-trained MOLGEN model. \u2022 Evaluate the generated molecules using seven established metrics: Validity, Fragment (Frag), Scaffold (Scaf), Similarity to Nearest Neighbor (SNN), Internal Diversity (IntDiv), Fr\u00e9chet ChemNet Distance (FCD), and Novelty as detailed in Appendix G. \u2022 Analyze additional molecular properties including atom counts, ring counts, molecular weights, and Bertz complexity (refer to Figure 6) to further assess the structural characteristics learned during pre-training. \u2022 Compare MOLGEN\u2019s metric scores with those reported for baselines such as AAE, LATENT GAN, CHARRNN, VAE, JT-VAE, LIMO, and CHEMFORMER using the data presented in Table 1. \u2022 Include visual validations from Appendix H.1 to contrast the training set and generated molecules, ensuring comprehensive assessment of chemical space exploration. \u2022 Perform statistical analyses to verify that MOLGEN's scores are significantly better, with particular emphasis on its performance on natural product molecules, and conduct constrained molecular optimization tests (Appendix H.3) to evaluate the preservation of high property scores (e.g., QED) while maintaining structural diversity.",
            "expected_outcome": "MOLGEN is expected to achieve near-perfect validity (approximately 1.000) while outperforming competing models in capturing the fragment and scaffold distributions. It should exhibit the highest SNN scores, the lowest FCD values, and robust performance on IntDiv and Novelty metrics, thereby demonstrating enhanced exploration of chemical space. Additional analyses are expected to confirm that the generated molecules possess structural properties (in terms of atom counts, ring counts, molecular weights, and Bertz complexity) consistently aligned with the reference distributions, particularly excelling in the natural product domain.",

            "hypothesis": "Incorporating the chemical feedback mechanism, which leverages properties such as p-logP, QED, and binding affinity, directly improves the generation of molecules with superior chemical properties and reduces molecular hallucinations in targeted molecule discovery tasks. We hypothesize that embedding this feedback loop will better align molecule generation with real-world distributions, preserving structural diversity (e.g., avoiding over-representation of ultra-long carbon chains) while enhancing property scores.",
            "method": "\u2022 Utilize a two-stage approach: pre-train on >100M molecules from the ZINC-15 dataset (molecules with molecular weight \u2264500 Daltons and LogP \u22645) and fine-tune on a synthetic dataset of 2.22M molecules spanning synthetic and natural product domains.  \u2022 Apply the chemical feedback paradigm during molecule generation on the synthetic dataset.  \u2022 Generate molecules optimized for high p-logP and QED properties, recording the top-3 property scores and comparing with baseline results as reported in Table 2.  \u2022 Assess binding affinities for two human protein targets, ESR1 and ACAA1, using AutoDockGPU to produce detailed docking simulation outputs; compare the optimized scores with those from leading baselines (see Table 3).  \u2022 Conduct pre- and post-optimization analysis on 1,000 molecules with initially low binding affinities for each target, visualizing improvements as illustrated in Figure 4.  \u2022 Additionally, evaluate structural diversity by examining features such as the occurrence of ultra-long carbon chains in high p-logP molecules.",
            "expected_outcome": "The experiment should demonstrate that MOLGEN, aided by the chemical feedback mechanism, is capable of generating molecules with exceptionally high p-logP scores (e.g., up to 80.30) while maintaining or surpassing QED performance relative to baselines (as detailed in Table 2). Furthermore, for binding affinity tasks the method is expected to achieve markedly lower KD values, with significant relative improvements (approximately 96.7% for ESR1 and 70.4% for ACAA1), thereby confirming its effectiveness in mitigating molecular hallucinations. Visualized improvements in binding affinities (Figure 4) alongside maintained molecular diversity will further substantiate the model's enhanced capabilities.",

This balance of property enhancement with preservation of molecular identity is hypothesized to address the issue of molecular hallucinations, as evidenced by consistent improvements over baseline methods.",

The result should indicate superior performance compared to other models that rely on additional retrieval databases or reward functions. Furthermore, the visual analyses are expected to confirm that MOLGEN successfully explores the proximate chemical space while preserving key molecular features, thereby alleviating molecular hallucinations and effectively balancing property enhancement with structural similarity.",

            "method": "Replicate the molecular distribution learning task on the synthetic MOSES dataset using four models: MOLGEN, a GRAPH-based model (Jin et al., 2018), a VAE-based model (Blaschke et al., 2018), and a SMILES-based PLM (Irwin et al., 2022). For each model: (a) Train using identical generation configurations and dataset splits as provided in the MOSES context (including hyperparameters detailed in Appendices C and G); (b) Generate a large set of molecules and calculate comprehensive property distributions, including 2D histograms for p-logP and QED scores, and individual histograms for atom counts, ring counts, molecular weights, and Bertz complexity; (c) Enforce synthetic molecule filters such as molecular weight \u2264500 Daltons and LogP \u22645 as applicable; (d) Compare the generated distributions against the training data using both visual analysis (referencing distributions similar to those in Figure 6 and Appendix Figures 1\u20133) and quantitative assessments such as KL-divergence to measure support of the training distribution; (e) Additionally, consider assessing the chemical feedback paradigm by verifying that optimized molecules (e.g., high p-logP and QED scores) maintain structural diversity as observed in the original experiments.",

It should produce molecular property distributions that are closer to the training data, accurately matching the main modes of p-logP and QED.

Use a mixed batch of molecules from both natural products and synthetic compound domains. Steps include: (a) Generate a set of molecules using the version without chemical feedback to establish a baseline property score; (b) Generate molecules with the chemical feedback mechanism activated; (c) Compute and compare property scores (e.g., p-logP and QED) for both groups; (d) Visualize the distribution shifts in property scores (using plots similar to those in Figure 7 and detailed analysis in Appendix H.2); (e) Statistically test the significance of the shift in property scores. All experimental settings (dataset, training parameters) should be consistent with those mentioned in the paper.",

This step should follow the normalization protocols presented in the paper; (e) Visualization and Statistical Analysis: Aggregate the SAL scores across models and visualize the distributions using box plots and distribution plots, referencing Figure 8 and supporting details from Appendix F and H.4. Additionally, conduct statistical tests (e.g., t-test or ANOVA) to determine whether the differences in SAL between models, particularly the prefix-enhanced MOLGEN versus the SMILES-based PLM, are significant; (f) Reporting: Document all hyperparameters (such as those used in the Pytorch implementation) and configuration details to ensure reproducibility.",
