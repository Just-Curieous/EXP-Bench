    "no_answer": "After thoroughly examining the repository, I could not find any scripts or notebooks specifically designed to analyze the Sub-structure Attention Level (SAL) metric or to compare attention patterns between MOLGEN with and without prefix enhancement as described in the experiment question. While the repository contains the implementation of the MOLGEN model and includes scripts for training with prefix enhancement (train_prefix.py), there are no scripts specifically for extracting attention weights, calculating the SAL metric, visualizing attention distributions, or conducting statistical tests to compare attention patterns between models. The experiment question describes a detailed methodology that would require custom scripts for attention analysis that do not appear to be present in the current repository."
