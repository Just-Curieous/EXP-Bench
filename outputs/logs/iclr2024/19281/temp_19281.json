            "hypothesis": "MOLGEN accurately captures real-world molecular distributions, generating molecules that are not only valid but also structurally diverse and consistent with reference distributions across both synthetic and natural product domains.",
            "method": "\u2022 Generate 10,000 synthetic molecules and 80,000 natural product molecules using the pre-trained MOLGEN model.  \u2022 Evaluate the generated molecules using the seven established metrics (Validity, Fragment (Frag), Scaffold (Scaf), Similarity to Nearest Neighbor (SNN), Internal Diversity (IntDiv), Fr\u00e9chet ChemNet Distance (FCD), and Novelty) as detailed in Appendix G.  \u2022 Compare MOLGEN\u2019s metric scores with those from baselines such as AAE, LATENT GAN, CHARRNN, VAE, JT-VAE, LIMO, and CHEMFORMER using Table 1.  \u2022 Perform a statistical analysis to verify whether MOLGEN's scores are significantly better, especially on natural products where structural complexity challenges most models.",
            "expected_outcome": "MOLGEN is expected to achieve perfect or near-perfect validity (1.000) and outperform competing models in capturing fragment and scaffold distributions, with highest SNN scores and lowest FCD. Its performance on IntDiv and Novelty should indicate enhanced exploration of chemical space, particularly evidencing superior performance on natural product molecules.",

            "hypothesis": "Incorporating the chemical feedback mechanism, which leverages properties such as p-logP, QED, and binding affinity, directly improves the generation of molecules with superior chemical properties, reducing molecular hallucinations in targeted molecule discovery tasks.",
            "method": "\u2022 Utilize the chemical feedback paradigm to guide molecule generation on the synthetic dataset.  \u2022 Generate molecules optimized for p-logP and QED properties, and record the top-3 property scores.  \u2022 Assess binding affinities for two human protein targets (ESR1 and ACAA1) using AutoDockGPU, producing docking simulation outputs.  \u2022 Compare the optimized property scores and binding affinities with those obtained from leading baselines as shown in Table 2 and Table 3.  \u2022 Additionally, perform pre- and post-optimization comparisons for 1,000 molecules with initially low binding affinities for each target, visualizing improvements as in Figure 4.",
            "expected_outcome": "The experiment should demonstrate that MOLGEN, through the chemical feedback mechanism, produces molecules with exceptionally high p-logP scores (e.g., up to 80.30) while maintaining QED performance comparable to or better than baselines. For binding affinity tasks, MOLGEN is expected to achieve markedly lower KD values and significant relative improvements (approximately 96.7% for ESR1 and 70.4% for ACAA1), confirming its enhanced ability to mitigate molecular hallucinations.",

            "hypothesis": "MOLGEN effectively performs constrained molecular optimization, significantly improving property scores (e.g., p-logP) while maintaining high structural similarity between the input and optimized molecules, thus balancing property enhancement with the preservation of molecular identity.",
            "method": "\u2022 Select 800 molecules from the ZINC250K dataset with the lowest initial p-logP scores.  \u2022 Apply the constrained optimization procedure using two similarity constraints (\u03b4 = 0.6 and \u03b4 = 0.4) as defined by Tanimoto similarity with Morgan fingerprints.  \u2022 Compute the mean and standard deviation of the p-logP improvements for each similarity constraint, and compare these with corresponding results from baseline methods presented in Table 4.  \u2022 Visualize a subset of before-and-after molecular structures to confirm that, despite property improvements, critical structural features are maintained.",

The results should confirm that the model can successfully explore proximate chemical space while preserving molecular similarity, thereby addressing the issue of molecular hallucinations.",

            "expected_outcome": "It is expected that MOLGEN will achieve significant elevation in QED scores (e.g., moving closer to or above 0.9478) for natural products while maintaining high structural similarity and diversity. The model\u2019s performance should support the claim that its optimization process does not excessively trade-off diversity for property enhancement.",

            "method": "Replicate the molecular distribution learning task on the synthetic MOSES dataset using four models: MOLGEN, a GRAPH-based model (Jin et al., 2018), a VAE-based model (Blaschke et al., 2018), and a SMILES-based PLM (Irwin et al., 2022). For each model: (a) Train under identical generation configurations; (b) Generate molecules and calculate comprehensive property distributions, including 2D histograms for p-logP and QED scores, and distributions for atom counts, ring counts, molecular weights, and Bertz complexity; (c) Compare the generated distributions against the training data distribution; (d) Quantitatively assess how closely each model fits the training distribution using relevant statistical metrics (e.g., KL-divergence) and visual analysis. The experimental details (dataset splits, training hyperparameters, and evaluation metrics) should mirror those provided in the MOSES dataset context.",

            "method": "Perform an ablation study on MOLGEN by using two configurations: one with chemical feedback enabled and one without. Use a mixed batch of molecules from both natural products and synthetic compound domains. Steps include: (a) Generate a set of molecules using the version without chemical feedback to establish a baseline property score; (b) Generate molecules with the chemical feedback mechanism activated; (c) Compute and compare property scores (e.g., p-logP and QED) for both groups; (d) Visualize the distribution shifts in property scores (using plots similar to those in Figure 7 and detailed analysis in Appendix H.2); (e) Statistically test the significance of the shift in property scores. All experimental settings (dataset, training parameters) should be consistent with those mentioned in the paper.",

            "method": "Design an experiment to compare models using the following steps: (a) Select a set of 200 molecules from PubChem with simple structures (only 1-2 functional groups) to avoid dilution of attention; (b) For each model (MOLGEN with prefix enhancement, MOLGEN without the enhanced prefix, and a standard SMILES-based PLM), extract and normalize attention weights from the final self-attention layer for each molecule; (c) Calculate the SAL metric for each molecule, defined as the percentage of attention allocated to tokens corresponding to known chemically relevant substructures; (d) Aggregate and compare SAL distributions across the three models using box plots and distribution plots (as shown in Figure 8 and supported by Appendix F and H.4); (e) Evaluate whether the prefix-enhanced MOLGEN offers a statistically significant increase in SAL compared to the SMILES-based PLM.",
