  "agent_instructions": "Create a Python script that analyzes molecular properties from the ZINC dataset. The script should:\n\n1. Load a sample of molecules from the ZINC dataset (you can use a small subset for demonstration purposes)\n2. For each molecule:\n   - Extract the SMILES notation\n   - Convert SMILES to SELFIES representation using the 'selfies' library\n   - Calculate the QED (Quantitative Estimation of Drug-likeness) value using RDKit\n3. Display information about each processed molecule, showing its SMILES string, SELFIES representation, and QED score\n4. Save all the processed data to a CSV file for further analysis\n\nRequired libraries:\n- RDKit for molecular processing and QED calculation\n- selfies for SMILES to SELFIES conversion\n- pandas for data handling and CSV export\n\nThe script should be modular with separate functions for data loading, SMILES-to-SELFIES conversion, and property calculation. Make sure to include appropriate error handling for invalid molecules."
