      "hypothesis": "For natural product molecules, MOLGEN can elevate QED scores through constrained optimization while preserving the inherent structural diversity, even in the context of complex and elongated molecular architectures. This improvement is expected to mirror prior results where MOLGEN achieved QED scores above 0.9478 while maintaining molecular similarity and structural diversity, as indicated by analyses in Table 2 and Appendix H.2.",
      "method": "\u2022 Focus on the natural products dataset and select molecules with suboptimal QED scores (generally below 0.9) for evaluation. \u2022 Implement a constrained optimization experiment that targets a significant increase in QED scores, ensuring the operation respects a similarity constraint based on Tanimoto similarity with Morgan fingerprints, thereby preserving key structural elements. \u2022 Utilize visual assessments (as illustrated in Figure 5 and Appendix H.3) alongside quantitative metrics to evaluate the improvement in QED scores and the retention of structural diversity. \u2022 Compare the optimization performance with previous baselines and results from models utilizing additional reward functions, property predictors, and retrieval databases. \u2022 Record detailed property variations and diversity changes as reflected in tables and visual figures (e.g., Figure 5, Table 2) to assess the balance between property enhancement and structural fidelity throughout the optimization process.",
      "expected_outcome": "It is expected that MOLGEN will significantly elevate QED scores for natural product molecules, achieving values closer to or surpassing 0.9478, while ensuring high structural similarity and preserving molecular diversity. The experiment should demonstrate that constrained optimization via MOLGEN effectively balances the enhancement of QED scores with the maintenance of inherent structural features, as evidenced by both quantitative metrics (Tanimoto similarity, QED score improvement) and qualitative visual assessments from the provided figures.",

      "usage_instructions": "To run the experiment for elevating QED scores of natural product molecules through constrained optimization while preserving structural diversity:\n\n1. First, ensure the checkpoint directory exists: `mkdir -p /workspace/moldata/checkpoint`\n\n2. Download the pre-trained model if not available: `wget -O /workspace/moldata/checkpoint/molgen.pkl https://huggingface.co/zjunlp/MolGen-large/resolve/main/molgen.pkl`\n\n3. Modify the generate.sh script to use the natural product dataset and QED property:\n   - Change `--input_path '../moldata/finetune/np_test.csv'` to use natural product test data\n   - Change `--property 'qed'` to optimize for QED\n   - Change `--generate_path '../moldata/generate/optimize_np_qed.csv'` for output\n   - Set `--exp_id qed` for the experiment ID\n\n4. Run the modified generate.sh script: `cd /workspace/MolGen && bash generate.sh`\n\n5. The script will generate optimized molecules with improved QED scores while maintaining structural similarity using Tanimoto similarity with Morgan fingerprints. The results will be saved to the specified generate_path, including QED scores and similarity metrics.",
