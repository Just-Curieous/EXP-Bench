    "no_answer": "After thoroughly examining the repository, I couldn't find specific scripts that directly compare different M values (4, 6, 8, 10) for the patch split parameter as described in the experiment question. The repository contains the CLIPSelf implementation with a default max_split parameter of 6 in the params.py file, and the GridDistillDataset class in data.py uses this parameter to initialize the patch choices. However, there are no scripts or evaluation tools that explicitly run experiments with different M values (4, 6, 8, 10) and compare their performance. The repository provides training scripts for CLIPSelf with image patches, but these use the default M=6 value without variations for comparison."
