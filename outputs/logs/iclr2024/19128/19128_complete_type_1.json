          "source": "Ambiguous patch selection method",
          "description": "The experiment does not explicitly state whether m and n are sampled independently or jointly from {1, ..., M}. This ambiguity can systematically bias the overall model performance if the patch splitting method consistently deviates from an optimal pattern. Such ambiguity, integrated within the self-distillation framework of the Teacher and Student networks, might lead to a consistent performance drop or uplift across all configurations.",
          "impact": "May result in systematic bias where the evaluated optimal configuration (M=6) appears superior due to the inherent design of the patch splitting method rather than reflecting an intrinsic model capability. The consistent bias can mask other factors that might influence model performance.",
          "possible_modifications": [
            "Clearly specify the patch selection procedure, detailing whether m and n are sampled independently or if a fixed grid structure is enforced.",
            "Perform additional ablation studies comparing fixed grid splits versus random sampling to better isolate and understand the systematic effects introduced by the patch selection method."

      "no_answer": "After thoroughly examining the repository, I couldn't find specific scripts that directly compare different M values (4, 6, 8, 10) for the patch split parameter as described in the experiment question. The repository contains the CLIPSelf implementation with a default max_split parameter of 6 in the params.py file, and the GridDistillDataset class in data.py uses this parameter to initialize the patch choices. However, there are no scripts or evaluation tools that explicitly run experiments with different M values (4, 6, 8, 10) and compare their performance. The repository provides training scripts for CLIPSelf with image patches, but these use the default M=6 value without variations for comparison."
