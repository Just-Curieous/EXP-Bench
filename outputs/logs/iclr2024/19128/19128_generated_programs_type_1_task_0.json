    "no_answer": "After thoroughly exploring the repository, I couldn't find scripts that directly answer the experiment question about whether increasing the number of learnable layers in the student model leads to a direct improvement in Top1 accuracy. While the repository contains code for the CLIPSelf framework and has parameters for controlling the number of learnable layers (via the --lock-image-unlocked-groups parameter), there are no scripts that systematically vary this parameter across the values 3, 6, 9, and 12 as specified in the experiment question. The existing scripts set specific values for the number of learnable layers (e.g., 12 for ViT-B/16 models and 24 for ViT-L/14 models), but they don't provide a direct way to run the experiment described in the question."
