      "question": "Will substituting the region-text supervision with the CLIPSelf self-distillation method improve the performance metrics (Top1/Top5) for Boxes, Thing Masks, and Stuff Masks?",
      "method": "1. **Problem Setup:** \n    - **Task:** \n    Compare the performance of two training setups on the same CLIP ViT-B/16 model: one using region-text supervision and the other using the CLIPSelf self-distillation method for dense recognition tasks.\n\n    - **Objective:** \n    Determine if substituting region-text supervision with the CLIPSelf self-distillation method improves performance metrics (Top1/Top5 accuracy) for Boxes, Thing Masks, and Stuff Masks.\n\n2. **Evaluation Metrics:**\n    - Top1 and Top5 accuracy for:\n        - Boxes\n        - Thing Masks\n        - Stuff Masks\n\n    -  Top1 and Top5 mean accuracy (mAcc) of classifying region boxes annotated in COCO\u2019s val2017 split and of classifying panoptic masks (thing and stuff) annotated in COCO Panoptic dataset (Kirillov et al., 2019). \n\n3. **Comparative Evaluation:**\n    - Model: (ViT-B/16 as backbone) (models are from EVA-CLIP)\n        - Training Setup:\n            - Region-text supervision (region proposals with object nouns)\n            - CLIPSelf self-distillation (no region-text pairs needed)\n\n4. **Training settings**:\n    - Using Region-Text pairs\n        - Follow the principle of RegionCLIP (Zhong et al.,2022) that matches region proposals with object nouns to generate region-text pairs to implement\n        - Adopt the methodology proposed in RegionCLIP (Zhong et al., 2022) to fine-tune CLIP ViTs using pseudo-labelled region-text pairs.\n        - Parse object nouns from the COCO Caption dataset (Chen et al., 2015) and generate region proposals using an RPN trained on COCO\u2019s 48 base categories.\n        - To establish correspondence between object nouns and region proposals, use the image-level features of the image crops enclosing the regions, considering the inferior dense representation of the original CLIP ViT.\n        - For a fair comparison, also fine-tune the model on the train2017 split of COCO dataset (Lin et al., 2014) for the same 6 epochs.\n    - Using CLIPSelf\n        - Also implement region proposal on CLIPSelf, for fair compairson",
      "expected_outcome": "Results suggest that using CLIPSelf improves metrics (e.g., Boxes Top1 increases from 71.1 to 74.0), supporting the notion that self-distillation is beneficial over traditional region-text pair methods.",

The region-text supervision approach relies on region proposals matched with object nouns, which may systematically bias the training data. Additionally, details such as the mask pooling method (referenced from He et al., 2017) are not fully elaborated, potentially introducing consistent bias in dense feature extraction. These factors can create an inherent difference between the two training branches (region-text supervision vs. CLIPSelf self-distillation), as shown by the changes in performance metrics in Table 6.",
          "impact": "This systematic bias could lead to a consistent over- or under-estimation of the performance improvements linked to CLIPSelf. The bias may compromise the generalizability of the findings, particularly on out-of-domain datasets such as CC3M or in other downstream tasks.",
