      "question": "Will implement CLIPSelf using region proposals generated by a region proposal network improve the performance metrics (Top1/Top5) for Boxes, Thing Masks, and Stuff Masks?",
      "method": "1. **Problem Setup:** \n    - **Task:** \n    Implement CLIPSelf using region proposals generated by a region proposal network (RPN) to evaluate improvements in performance metrics (Top1/Top5 accuracy) for Boxes, Thing Masks, and Stuff Masks.\n\n    - **Objective:** \n    Determine if leveraging region proposals boosts classification accuracy, especially for foreground instances, while assessing impacts on background content recognition.\n\n2. **Evaluation Metrics:**\n    - Top1 and Top5 accuracy for:\n        - Boxes\n        - Thing Masks \n        - Stuff Masks\n\n    -  Top1 and Top5 mean accuracy (mAcc) of classifying region boxes annotated in COCO\u2019s val2017 split and of classifying panoptic masks (thing and stuff) annotated in COCO Panoptic dataset (Kirillov et al., 2019). \n\n3. **Comparative Evaluation:**\n    - Model:\n        - ViT-B/16 Baseline (without CLIPSelf) (from EVA-CLIP)\n        - ViT-B/16 with CLIPSelf (from EVS-CLIP)\n\n4. **Training settings**:\n    - ViT-B/16 with CLIPSelf\n        - Setup:\n            - Use 8 A100 GPUs with a batch size of 2 per GPU.\n            - Train for 6 epochs.\n        - Optimization Parameters:\n            - Optimizer: AdamW.\n            - Learning Rate: 1e-5.\n            - Weight Decay: 0.1.\n        - Model Configuration:\n            - Employ a frozen CLIP ViT backbone (ViT-B/16 from EVA-CLIP) for the Teacher model with input resolution of 224\u00d7224.\n            - Set the Student model input resolution to 1024\u00d71024 for dense region feature extraction.\n        - Patch Splitting Strategy:\n            - Utilize m\u00d7n patches where m, n are randomly sampled from {1,...,6}.\n        - Model:\n            - ViT-B/16 from EVA-CLIP\n        - Training images:\n            - train2017 split of COCO dataset\n\n    - ViT-B/16 with CLIPSelf and Region Proposals\n        - Implement CLIPSelf using region proposals generated by a region proposal network (RPN) trained on COCO\u2019s train2017split. To satisfy the open-vocabulary setting, the RPN is trained solely using annotations of the 48 base object categories defined in OVCOCO.",
