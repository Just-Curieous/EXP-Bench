Implement four scheduling methods \u2013 1F1B, 1F1B-I, ZB-1p, and ZB-2p \u2013 as provided in the zero bubble pipeline parallelism implementation. For each configuration, measure the throughput in samples per second per GPU after a fixed warm-up period. Record the throughput values for each method across the microbatch settings and compare the trends to determine whether 1F1B, 1F1B-I, and ZB-1p exhibit improved throughput with an increasing number of microbatches, and if ZB-2p consistently maintains throughput close to its upper bound even with fewer microbatches.",

Measure throughput in samples per second per GPU and record detailed empirical measurements including stage-wise computation timings (TF, TB, TW), communication timings (Tcomm), and bubble rates.

Specifically, can we observe that the throughput of ZB-2p remains consistently close to the ideal upper bound (defined as the computation-only throughput adjusted by the bubble rate) across different microbatch counts (e.g., 96, 128, and 256), compared to the throughput gains of the other methods?",

Use microbatch counts of 96, 128, and 256 as specified in the related tables and figures. Implement and compare four scheduling methods: 1F1B, 1F1B-I, ZB-1p, and ZB-2p. When implementing the ZB schedules, ensure that the appropriate command line flags are used to control the pipeline scheduling behavior. For example, according to the repository\u2019s guidelines, setting '--zero-bubble-max-pending-backward' to 1\u00d7 the number of pipelines yields a schedule like ZB-1p and to 2\u00d7 yields ZB-2p. Additionally, use the '--enable-zero-bubble' and '--zero-bubble-v-schedule' flags (or related flags) as needed to enable zero bubble scheduling. Collect detailed empirical measurements of computation times (TF, TB, TW) and communication times (Tcomm) as described, and use these to compute the estimated upper bound throughput (computed as m*(TF+TB+TW) with full overlap assumptions) and bubble rates (as outlined in the associated experimental tables). Record throughput in samples per second per GPU and memory usage per experiment. Use the Megatron-LM implementation with a fixed random seed for reproducibility and verify the bit-to-bit equivalence of loss outputs across methods. Refer to the experimental details discussed in the paper (including data found in Tables 3, 4, and 9 as well as Figure 5) to guide the comparative analysis.",

In contrast, while throughput for methods such as 1F1B and 1F1B-I may show increases as the microbatch count increases, they will not reach the near-optimal throughput observed with ZB-2p.

Evaluate each configuration across different numbers of pipeline stages and microbatch counts (for example, 1.5B at p = 8 with microbatch counts of 24, 32, and 64, plus the corresponding settings for larger models). Perform these calculations for each method: 1F1B, 1F1B-I, ZB-H1, ZB-H2, ZB-1p, and ZB-2p. Additionally, include cases with m \u2264 p (following the approach detailed in Appendix H) to assess the impact on bubble rate and memory consumption. Be sure to enable the zero bubble scheduling mechanism as described in the repository (for example, by using the equivalent of --zero-bubble-v-schedule along with setting --zero-bubble-max-pending-backward to a value that produces a ZB2P-like schedule) so that the design\u2014where the backward pass is broken into B and W passes to nearly eliminate bubbles\u2014is activated. Finally, cross-reference the theoretical calculations with the empirical validations provided in the associated tables and figures to verify that ZB-2p attains bubble rates close to zero as expected.",

In contrast, methods like ZB-H2 are expected to perform consistently worse than ZB-2p. ZB-1p should show comparable throughput to 1F1B-I in 8-GPU setups but excel in multi-node setups where communication bandwidth is a bottleneck. The improvements should be evident in both large-scale model configurations (e.g., 28.3B) and under varying microbatch counts, with additional validation from cases where m \u2264 p showing 20% to 30% gains with a similar memory footprint.",

Ensure that both methods run under identical activation memory limits, as suggested by the repository\u2019s guidelines for setting controllable memory (using appropriate flags or patches) so that the peak memory consumption is comparable. Additionally, incorporate data from Table 5 and any relevant figures that illustrate these bubble rates, and profile the execution times (TF, TB, TW, and Tcomm) to detail how memory constraints might negate the benefits of an automatic search strategy. This detailed profiling and direct comparison will help determine if the memory limitations cause the automatic scheduling method and the handcrafted schedule to yield similar bubble rates.",

Next, execute the ZB-2p schedule on the 16 GPUs and record the stage execution timeline.

This script tests different pipeline parallelism schedules including zero bubble configurations with varying memory limits. To specifically focus on the memory limit experiment:\n\n1. Modify the script to test different memory limits by changing the ZERO_BUBBLE_MEM_LIMIT variable in the 'zb' method section (around line 106). Instead of the default value of 2 * PIPELINE_SIZE, create multiple test cases with different values (e.g., PIPELINE_SIZE, 1.5 * PIPELINE_SIZE, 2 * PIPELINE_SIZE, 2.5 * PIPELINE_SIZE).\n\n2. Run the script which will execute tests for each memory limit configuration and output the bubble rate for each case.\n\n3. The script already includes configurations for testing ZB (zero bubble with configurable memory limit), ZBV (zero bubble V-schedule), ZBV-half (half memory), and ZBV-min (minimum memory), which collectively demonstrate the relationship between memory limit and bubble rate.\n\nThe results will show that as the memory limit increases, the bubble rate decreases linearly until reaching a plateau near the theoretical threshold of 2pMB (where p is the number of pipeline stages), confirming the expected behavior described in the experiment question.",

Ensure that all other system conditions remain identical throughout the experiments.

        "The paper introduces and evaluates advanced pipeline parallelism methods (ZB-1p and ZB-2p) and compares them with existing schedules (1F1B and 1F1B-I) on various model sizes.",
        "Experiments conducted on up to 32 NVIDIA A100 SXM 80G GPUs demonstrate that ZB methods can achieve higher throughput in samples per second under different microbatch configurations.",
        "Using an optimizer post-validation strategy leads to approximately an 8% throughput improvement over standard all-reduce synchronization.",
        "Under the same memory consumption, increasing the microbatch size in methods like 1F1B and ZB-1p shows different performance trade-offs, with ZB-2p generally providing the highest throughput.",
        "The reproducibility of training loss (bit-to-bit identical results across iterations) validates the correctness and consistency of the proposed pipeline methods."
