      "question": "Does reducing the number of pipeline stages improve throughput across different scheduling methods (1F1B, 1F1B-I, ZB-1p, and ZB-2p) in a multi-node setup, specifically for a 14.6B model on 16 GPUs? (For the ZB-based methods, ensure that you enable zero bubble scheduling via the appropriate command-line flags and set the '--zero-bubble-max-pending-backward' parameter (using 1x for ZB-1p and 2x for ZB-2p) as recommended.)",
      "method": "Design an experiment using a 14.6B parameter model configured with 46 layers, 40 attention heads, a hidden size of 5120, and a sequence length of 1024, deployed on 16 NVIDIA A100 GPUs. Vary the number of pipeline stages by changing the microbatch configuration with values of 48, 64, and 128 microbatches while keeping all other settings constant. For each configuration, execute training using four scheduling methods: 1F1B, 1F1B-I, ZB-1p, and ZB-2p. For the ZB-based schedules, include the zero bubble scheduling flags (e.g., '--enable-zero-bubble') and set '--zero-bubble-max-pending-backward' appropriately (1x for ZB-1p and 2x for ZB-2p) as per best practices. Measure throughput in samples per second per GPU and record detailed empirical measurements including stage-wise computation timings (TF, TB, TW), communication timings (Tcomm), and bubble rates. Ensure experimental consistency by fixing the random seed, using warm-up iterations, and maintaining fixed optimizer steps to control for confounding factors.",
      "expected_outcome": "It is expected that reducing the number of pipeline stages (i.e., using fewer microbatches or a configuration with reduced stage count) will lead to higher throughput for all scheduling methods due to decreased pipeline bubble overhead. However, the improvement should vary by method. In particular, the ZB-based methods, especially ZB-2p, are anticipated to maintain a performance advantage by effectively managing pipeline bubbles, yielding throughput figures closer to the theoretical upper bound as illustrated by the empirical results in Table 4 and Figure 5. This experimental setup should provide low-level details and comprehensive measurements to validate the hypothesis under controlled settings.",

      "usage_instructions": "To run the experiment comparing throughput across different scheduling methods with varying pipeline stages for a 14.6B model on 16 GPUs, follow these steps:\n\n1. Modify the `/workspace/examples/test_all_schedules.sh` script with the following changes:\n   - Update the `methods` array to include only the required scheduling methods: \"1f1b\", \"1f1b-interleaved\", \"zb\" (for ZB-1p), and a second \"zb\" configuration (for ZB-2p)\n   - Set `PIPELINE_SIZE=16` to use all 16 GPUs\n   - Set `LAYERS=46` for the 14.6B model\n   - Set `HIDDEN_SIZE=5120` and `ATTENTION_HEADS=40` as specified\n   - Set `SEQ_LENGTH=1024` as specified\n   - Add a loop to vary the microbatch size with values 48, 64, and 128\n   - For the ZB-1p configuration, set `ZERO_BUBBLE_MEM_LIMIT=$PIPELINE_SIZE` (1x pipeline size)\n   - For the ZB-2p configuration, set `ZERO_BUBBLE_MEM_LIMIT=$((2 * $PIPELINE_SIZE))` (2x pipeline size)\n\n2. Execute the modified script, which will run all the specified scheduling methods with different microbatch configurations and collect throughput measurements.\n\nThe script will automatically run the experiments using the `pretrain_zero_bubble.sh` script, which handles the actual training process with the specified configuration. The results will be logged to the `./logs` directory, where you can analyze the throughput measurements for each configuration.",
