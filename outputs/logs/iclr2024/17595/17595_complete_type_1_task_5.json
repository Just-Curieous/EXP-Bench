      "question": "Does the memory limitation impact scheduling efficiency such that the automatic scheduling method, ZB-1p, and its handcrafted counterpart, ZB-H1, yield similar pipeline bubble rates? In your analysis, consider that both scheduling methods should be run under identical activation memory constraints as recommended in the repository (e.g., setting memory limits via flags like --zero-bubble-v-schedule-mem-setup for the V schedule or applying the lightweight patch for ZB-H1).",
      "method": "Select two model sizes (e.g., 1.5B and 6.2B models with 8 pipeline stages) and evaluate each across multiple microbatch configurations (24, 32, and 64 microbatches). For both ZB-1p and ZB-H1, compute the bubble rates using the formula: bubble rate = (cost \u2212 m*(TF+TB+TW)) / cost, where m is the number of microbatches and TF, TB, and TW represent computation costs for various transformer operations. Ensure that both methods run under identical activation memory limits, as suggested by the repository\u2019s guidelines for setting controllable memory (using appropriate flags or patches) so that the peak memory consumption is comparable. Additionally, incorporate data from Table 5 and any relevant figures that illustrate these bubble rates, and profile the execution times (TF, TB, TW, and Tcomm) to detail how memory constraints might negate the benefits of an automatic search strategy. This detailed profiling and direct comparison will help determine if the memory limitations cause the automatic scheduling method and the handcrafted schedule to yield similar bubble rates.",
      "expected_outcome": "It is expected that the computed bubble rates for ZB-1p and ZB-H1 will be very close or similar under memory constrained conditions. This would support the claim that when the activation memory is strictly limited to pMB, the influence of memory limitations dominates, reducing the potential performance gains from automatic scheduling as compared to the handcrafted approach.",

      "usage_instructions": "To compare ZB-1p and ZB-H1 scheduling methods under memory constraints, follow these steps:\n\n1. First, run the ZB-1p schedule using the test_all_schedules.sh script with appropriate parameters:\n   ```\n   export PIPELINE_SIZE=8  # For 8 pipeline stages\n   export MICRO_BATCH_SIZE=24  # Try with 24, 32, and 64 microbatches\n   export ENABLE_ZERO_BUBBLE=1  # Enable Zero Bubble\n   export ZERO_BUBBLE_MEM_LIMIT=$((1 * $PIPELINE_SIZE))  # Set memory limit to 1x pipeline size for ZB-1p\n   bash examples/test_all_schedules.sh\n   ```\n\n2. Then, run the ZB-H1 schedule with identical memory constraints:\n   ```\n   export PIPELINE_SIZE=8  # For 8 pipeline stages\n   export MICRO_BATCH_SIZE=24  # Try with 24, 32, and 64 microbatches\n   export SYNC_OPTIMIZER=1  # Enable synchronous optimizer for ZB-H1\n   export ENABLE_ZERO_BUBBLE=1  # Enable Zero Bubble\n   export ZERO_BUBBLE_MEM_LIMIT=$((1 * $PIPELINE_SIZE))  # Set memory limit to 1x pipeline size for ZB-H1\n   export EXTRA_OPTIONS=\"--zero-bubble-v-schedule-mem-setup half\"  # Set memory setup to half for controlled memory\n   bash examples/test_all_schedules.sh\n   ```\n\n3. After running both configurations, analyze the logs to extract the bubble rates and execution times:\n   ```\n   # Process the nsys profiling data to visualize and analyze the schedules\n   python tools/viz_nsys_events.py -i \"logs/test/zb.json\" -o zb_1p_analysis.svg -n 2 -w 1000\n   python tools/viz_nsys_events.py -i \"logs/test/zbv-half.json\" -o zb_h1_analysis.svg -n 2 -w 1000\n   ```\n\n4. Calculate the bubble rates using the formula: bubble rate = (cost - m*(TF+TB+TW)) / cost, where m is the number of microbatches and TF, TB, and TW represent computation costs for various transformer operations. These values can be extracted from the profiling data in the logs.\n\nRepeat steps 1-4 for different model sizes (adjust HIDDEN_SIZE and LAYERS parameters) and microbatch configurations (24, 32, and 64) to complete the experiment.",
