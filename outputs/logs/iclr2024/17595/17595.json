(Note: These methods are implemented as part of the zero bubble pipeline parallelism strategies in this repository, which aim to reduce pipeline bubbles and maintain high throughput.)",
            "method": "Run controlled experiments on a 1.5B parameter model using 8 GPUs. Configure the system to use three different microbatch settings: 24, 32, and 64 microbatches. Implement four scheduling methods \u2013 1F1B, 1F1B-I, ZB-1p, and ZB-2p \u2013 as provided in the zero bubble pipeline parallelism implementation. For each configuration, measure the throughput in samples per second per GPU after a fixed warm-up period. Record the throughput values for each method across the microbatch settings and compare the trends to determine whether 1F1B, 1F1B-I, and ZB-1p exhibit improved throughput with an increasing number of microbatches, and if ZB-2p consistently maintains throughput close to its upper bound even with fewer microbatches.",
            "expected_outcome": "Based on the reported results, 1F1B, 1F1B-I, and ZB-1p should show a strong positive correlation between the number of microbatches and throughput, while ZB-2p is expected to deliver consistently high throughput (close to the upper bound) irrespective of the microbatch count.",

            "method": "Set up experiments using a chosen model configuration (for example, a 6.2B model on 8 GPUs). Enable zero bubble scheduling using flags like --enable-zero-bubble and set --zero-bubble-max-pending-backward to 2\u00d7 the number of pipeline stages to activate the ZB-2p mode. Adjust the configuration so that both ZB-2p and 1F1B operate under the same peak memory budget; this may involve doubling the microbatch size for 1F1B as suggested. Keep all other conditions constant (e.g., warm-up iterations, random seeds, optimizer post validation using --enable-optimizer-post-validation, network and hardware conditions). Record the samples per GPU per second for each method, and compare how throughput scales with different microbatch counts as indicated in the repository documentation.",
            "expected_outcome": "It is expected that ZB-2p will demonstrate higher throughput compared to 1F1B under identical memory consumption, even with a lower microbatch count. The efficient scheduling in ZB-2p, which nearly eliminates pipeline bubbles, should allow its throughput to approach the upper bound (e.g., throughput values around 4.32\u20134.39 samples per second for the 6.2B model on 8 GPUs as observed in Table 4) whereas 1F1B is expected to yield lower throughput.

(For the ZB-based methods, ensure that you enable zero bubble scheduling via the appropriate command-line flags and set the '--zero-bubble-max-pending-backward' parameter (using 1x for ZB-1p and 2x for ZB-2p) as recommended.)",

For each configuration, execute training using four scheduling methods: 1F1B, 1F1B-I, ZB-1p, and ZB-2p. For the ZB-based schedules, include the zero bubble scheduling flags (e.g., '--enable-zero-bubble') and set '--zero-bubble-max-pending-backward' appropriately (1x for ZB-1p and 2x for ZB-2p) as per best practices. Measure throughput in samples per second per GPU and record detailed empirical measurements including stage-wise computation timings (TF, TB, TW), communication timings (Tcomm), and bubble rates. Ensure experimental consistency by fixing the random seed, using warm-up iterations, and maintaining fixed optimizer steps to control for confounding factors.",
            "expected_outcome": "It is expected that reducing the number of pipeline stages (i.e., using fewer microbatches or a configuration with reduced stage count) will lead to higher throughput for all scheduling methods due to decreased pipeline bubble overhead. However, the improvement should vary by method. In particular, the ZB-based methods, especially ZB-2p, are anticipated to maintain a performance advantage by effectively managing pipeline bubbles, yielding throughput figures closer to the theoretical upper bound as illustrated by the empirical results in Table 4 and Figure 5.

Specifically, can we observe that the throughput of ZB-2p remains consistently close to the ideal upper bound (defined as the computation-only throughput adjusted by the bubble rate) across different microbatch counts (e.g., 96, 128, and 256), compared to the throughput gains of the other methods?",

When implementing the ZB schedules, ensure that the appropriate command line flags are used to control the pipeline scheduling behavior. For example, according to the repository\u2019s guidelines, setting '--zero-bubble-max-pending-backward' to 1\u00d7 the number of pipelines yields a schedule like ZB-1p and to 2\u00d7 yields ZB-2p. Additionally, use the '--enable-zero-bubble' and '--zero-bubble-v-schedule' flags (or related flags) as needed to enable zero bubble scheduling. Collect detailed empirical measurements of computation times (TF, TB, TW) and communication times (Tcomm) as described, and use these to compute the estimated upper bound throughput (computed as m*(TF+TB+TW) with full overlap assumptions) and bubble rates (as outlined in the associated experimental tables). Record throughput in samples per second per GPU and memory usage per experiment. Use the Megatron-LM implementation with a fixed random seed for reproducibility and verify the bit-to-bit equivalence of loss outputs across methods. Refer to the experimental details discussed in the paper (including data found in Tables 3, 4, and 9 as well as Figure 5) to guide the comparative analysis.",

Evaluate each configuration across different numbers of pipeline stages and microbatch counts (for example, 1.5B at p = 8 with microbatch counts of 24, 32, and 64, plus the corresponding settings for larger models). Perform these calculations for each method: 1F1B, 1F1B-I, ZB-H1, ZB-H2, ZB-1p, and ZB-2p. Additionally, include cases with m \u2264 p (following the approach detailed in Appendix H) to assess the impact on bubble rate and memory consumption. Be sure to enable the zero bubble scheduling mechanism as described in the repository (for example, by using the equivalent of --zero-bubble-v-schedule along with setting --zero-bubble-max-pending-backward to a value that produces a ZB2P-like schedule) so that the design\u2014where the backward pass is broken into B and W passes to nearly eliminate bubbles\u2014is activated. Finally, cross-reference the theoretical calculations with the empirical validations provided in the associated tables and figures to verify that ZB-2p attains bubble rates close to zero as expected.",

In contrast, methods like ZB-H2 are expected to perform consistently worse than ZB-2p. ZB-1p should show comparable throughput to 1F1B-I in 8-GPU setups but excel in multi-node setups where communication bandwidth is a bottleneck.

For both ZB-1p and ZB-H1, compute the bubble rates using the formula: bubble rate = (cost \u2212 m*(TF+TB+TW)) / cost, where m is the number of microbatches and TF, TB, and TW represent computation costs for various transformer operations. Ensure that both methods run under identical activation memory limits, as suggested by the repository\u2019s guidelines for setting controllable memory (using appropriate flags or patches) so that the peak memory consumption is comparable. Additionally, incorporate data from Table 5 and any relevant figures that illustrate these bubble rates, and profile the execution times (TF, TB, TW, and Tcomm) to detail how memory constraints might negate the benefits of an automatic search strategy. This detailed profiling and direct comparison will help determine if the memory limitations cause the automatic scheduling method and the handcrafted schedule to yield similar bubble rates.",

This would support the claim that when the activation memory is strictly limited to pMB, the influence of memory limitations dominates, reducing the potential performance gains from automatic scheduling as compared to the handcrafted approach.",

First, perform a theoretical calculation of the bubble rate for ZB-2p using profiled values from preliminary runs (TF, TB, TW, and Tcomm) to compute the ideal execution time defined as m(TF + TB + TW) under the assumption of complete overlap of communications with computations. Next, execute the ZB-2p schedule on the 16 GPUs and record the stage execution timeline. Overlay the computed schedule with the actual profiled timeline to identify any bubbles (idle time) in each stage. Finally, compare the observed bubble rate with the related throughput and bubble rate metrics as reported to evaluate the discrepancy between the theoretical expectation and practical performance.",

Although the real execution profile might reveal slightly higher bubbles due to minor overheads compared to the ideal theoretical calculation, it should still largely validate the claim of a near-zero bubble schedule, as evidenced by high throughput rates (referenced in Table 4) and the tight alignment in the stage execution timeline (as illustrated in Figure 6).",

Ensure that all other system conditions remain identical throughout the experiments. For each memory limit configuration, run the pipeline scheduling algorithm multiple times to capture variability in the bubble rate. The bubble rate should be measured and compared across configurations to assess whether the 2pMB limit produces an empirically near-zero bubble rate and if increasing the memory limit further leads to diminishing improvements.
