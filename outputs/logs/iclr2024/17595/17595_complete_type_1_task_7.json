      "question": "Does increasing the memory limit (Mlimit) result in a linear decrease in the bubble rate until a plateau is reached near the theoretical threshold? When running experiments with zero bubble pipeline parallelism\u2014as enabled via the recommended flags (e.g., --zero-bubble-v-schedule and relevant memory configuration flags)\u2014does the observed trend conform to the predicted linear decrease and plateau behavior when using fixed settings for TF, TB, and Tcomm?",
      "method": "Set up a controlled experiment using the zero bubble pipeline parallelism framework provided in the repository. Vary the memory limit (Mlimit) across a broad range of values, from very low up to values beyond the theoretical inflection point. Use fixed parameters (ensuring TF \u2248 TB and relatively small Tcomm) as described in the experiment, and apply configurations similar to those in Figure 7 for the 14.6B Model (p = 16) and the 28.3B Model (p = 32) with numbers of microbatches such as 48, 64, 128 (for the 14.6B Model) and 96, 128, 256 (for the 28.3B Model). For each chosen Mlimit value, record the bubble rate over multiple iterations to ensure statistical reliability. Additionally, compare the bubble rates with baseline schedules (e.g., ZB-1p, handcrafted schedules like ZB-H1 and ZB-H2) and with the automatically optimized schedule ZB-2p, which in prior setups has achieved near-zero bubble rates. The setup can benefit from the codebase\u2019s configurable memory controls (such as those enabled via command line flags for zero bubble scheduling) detailed in the repository's documentation.",
      "expected_outcome": "It is expected that the bubble rate will decrease nearly linearly with increasing Mlimit until reaching a plateau. The plateau should be observed for a memory limit of approximately 2pMB, validating the empirical claim that 2pMB is an effective threshold for achieving near-zero bubble rate when TF \u2248 TB and Tcomm is relatively small. The experimental results are also anticipated to align with observations from Figure 7 and Table 5, where the automatically searched schedule ZB-2p demonstrates a bubble rate of less than 1% and outperforms other methods such as ZB-1p and the handcrafted schedules.",

      "usage_instructions": "To test whether increasing the memory limit (Mlimit) results in a linear decrease in bubble rate until a plateau is reached near the theoretical threshold, run the test_all_schedules.sh script. This script tests different pipeline parallelism schedules including zero bubble configurations with varying memory limits. To specifically focus on the memory limit experiment:\n\n1. Modify the script to test different memory limits by changing the ZERO_BUBBLE_MEM_LIMIT variable in the 'zb' method section (around line 106). Instead of the default value of 2 * PIPELINE_SIZE, create multiple test cases with different values (e.g., PIPELINE_SIZE, 1.5 * PIPELINE_SIZE, 2 * PIPELINE_SIZE, 2.5 * PIPELINE_SIZE).\n\n2. Run the script which will execute tests for each memory limit configuration and output the bubble rate for each case.\n\n3. The script already includes configurations for testing ZB (zero bubble with configurable memory limit), ZBV (zero bubble V-schedule), ZBV-half (half memory), and ZBV-min (minimum memory), which collectively demonstrate the relationship between memory limit and bubble rate.\n\nThe results will show that as the memory limit increases, the bubble rate decreases linearly until reaching a plateau near the theoretical threshold of 2pMB (where p is the number of pipeline stages), confirming the expected behavior described in the experiment question.",
