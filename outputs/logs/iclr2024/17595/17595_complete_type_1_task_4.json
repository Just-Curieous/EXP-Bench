      "question": "Does the automatic scheduling algorithm (specifically ZB-2p) produce significantly lower bubble rates compared to both traditional methods (1F1B, 1F1B-I) and handcrafted schedules (ZB-H1, ZB-H2) across different model scales and microbatch counts when using the zero bubble pipeline parallelism framework (with the corresponding scheduler flags enabled)?",
      "method": "For each model configuration (1.5B, 6.2B, 14.6B, and 28.3B parameters) as specified in Table 3, execute the theoretical scheduling setup by measuring the profiled values of TF, TB, TW, and Tcomm (as obtained from the pipeline parallel runtime) and compute the bubble rate using the formula: bubble rate = (cost \u2212 m*(TF+TB+TW)) / cost. Evaluate each configuration across different numbers of pipeline stages and microbatch counts (for example, 1.5B at p = 8 with microbatch counts of 24, 32, and 64, plus the corresponding settings for larger models). Perform these calculations for each method: 1F1B, 1F1B-I, ZB-H1, ZB-H2, ZB-1p, and ZB-2p. Additionally, include cases with m \u2264 p (following the approach detailed in Appendix H) to assess the impact on bubble rate and memory consumption. Be sure to enable the zero bubble scheduling mechanism as described in the repository (for example, by using the equivalent of --zero-bubble-v-schedule along with setting --zero-bubble-max-pending-backward to a value that produces a ZB2P-like schedule) so that the design\u2014where the backward pass is broken into B and W passes to nearly eliminate bubbles\u2014is activated. Finally, cross-reference the theoretical calculations with the empirical validations provided in the associated tables and figures to verify that ZB-2p attains bubble rates close to zero as expected.",
      "expected_outcome": "It is anticipated that the automatic scheduling algorithm, especially ZB-2p, will achieve bubble rates substantially below 1% across nearly all configurations, outperforming the traditional methods (1F1B, 1F1B-I) and handcrafted schedules (ZB-H1, ZB-H2). In contrast, methods like ZB-H2 are expected to perform consistently worse than ZB-2p. ZB-1p should show comparable throughput to 1F1B-I in 8-GPU setups but excel in multi-node setups where communication bandwidth is a bottleneck. The improvements should be evident in both large-scale model configurations (e.g., 28.3B) and under varying microbatch counts, with additional validation from cases where m \u2264 p showing 20% to 30% gains with a similar memory footprint.",

      "usage_instructions": "To compare the bubble rates of different scheduling algorithms (ZB-2p, 1F1B, 1F1B-I, ZB-H1, ZB-H2) across different model scales and microbatch counts:\n\n1. Modify the test_all_schedules.sh script to include the model configurations from Table 3 (1.5B, 6.2B, 14.6B, and 28.3B parameters) by adjusting the HIDDEN_SIZE, ATTENTION_HEADS, and LAYERS variables.\n\n2. For each model configuration, set the appropriate PIPELINE_SIZE (number of pipeline stages) and test with different MICRO_BATCH_SIZE values (e.g., 24, 32, 64).\n\n3. Make sure all the scheduling methods are uncommented in the 'methods' array (lines 10-19): \"1f1b\", \"1f1b-interleaved\" (for 1F1B-I), \"zb\" (for ZB-2p), and add \"zb-h1\" and \"zb-h2\" for the handcrafted schedules.\n\n4. Run the script with: `bash examples/test_all_schedules.sh`\n\n5. The script will execute each scheduling method with the specified configuration and output logs to the ./logs directory.\n\n6. The bubble rates can be extracted from the logs by looking for the throughput and execution time metrics, which can be used to calculate the bubble rate using the formula: bubble rate = (cost - m*(TF+TB+TW)) / cost.\n\nNote: The script already enables the zero bubble scheduling mechanism through the appropriate flags (--zero-bubble-v-schedule, --enable-zero-bubble, etc.) as required in the experiment question.",
