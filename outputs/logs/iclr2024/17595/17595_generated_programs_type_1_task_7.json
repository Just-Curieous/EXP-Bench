    "usage_instructions": "To test whether increasing the memory limit (Mlimit) results in a linear decrease in bubble rate until a plateau is reached near the theoretical threshold, run the test_all_schedules.sh script. This script tests different pipeline parallelism schedules including zero bubble configurations with varying memory limits. To specifically focus on the memory limit experiment:\n\n1. Modify the script to test different memory limits by changing the ZERO_BUBBLE_MEM_LIMIT variable in the 'zb' method section (around line 106). Instead of the default value of 2 * PIPELINE_SIZE, create multiple test cases with different values (e.g., PIPELINE_SIZE, 1.5 * PIPELINE_SIZE, 2 * PIPELINE_SIZE, 2.5 * PIPELINE_SIZE).\n\n2. Run the script which will execute tests for each memory limit configuration and output the bubble rate for each case.\n\n3. The script already includes configurations for testing ZB (zero bubble with configurable memory limit), ZBV (zero bubble V-schedule), ZBV-half (half memory), and ZBV-min (minimum memory), which collectively demonstrate the relationship between memory limit and bubble rate.\n\nThe results will show that as the memory limit increases, the bubble rate decreases linearly until reaching a plateau near the theoretical threshold of 2pMB (where p is the number of pipeline stages), confirming the expected behavior described in the experiment question."
