      "question": "Does the throughput for methods 1F1B, 1F1B-I, and ZB-1p improve as the number of microbatches increases, while ZB-2p maintains high throughput even with fewer microbatches? (Note: These methods are implemented as part of the zero bubble pipeline parallelism strategies in this repository, which aim to reduce pipeline bubbles and maintain high throughput.)",
      "method": "Run controlled experiments on a 1.5B parameter model using 8 GPUs. Configure the system to use three different microbatch settings: 24, 32, and 64 microbatches. Implement four scheduling methods \u2013 1F1B, 1F1B-I, ZB-1p, and ZB-2p \u2013 as provided in the zero bubble pipeline parallelism implementation. For each configuration, measure the throughput in samples per second per GPU after a fixed warm-up period. Record the throughput values for each method across the microbatch settings and compare the trends to determine whether 1F1B, 1F1B-I, and ZB-1p exhibit improved throughput with an increasing number of microbatches, and if ZB-2p consistently maintains throughput close to its upper bound even with fewer microbatches.",
      "expected_outcome": "Based on the reported results, 1F1B, 1F1B-I, and ZB-1p should show a strong positive correlation between the number of microbatches and throughput, while ZB-2p is expected to deliver consistently high throughput (close to the upper bound) irrespective of the microbatch count.",

      "usage_instructions": "To run the experiment comparing throughput for 1F1B, 1F1B-I, ZB-1p, and ZB-2p with different microbatch settings (24, 32, and 64), follow these steps:\n\n1. Modify the test_all_schedules.sh script to set the desired microbatch sizes:\n   - For 24 microbatches: Set MICRO_BATCH_SIZE=1 and GLOBAL_BATCH_SIZE=24\n   - For 32 microbatches: Set MICRO_BATCH_SIZE=1 and GLOBAL_BATCH_SIZE=32\n   - For 64 microbatches: Set MICRO_BATCH_SIZE=1 and GLOBAL_BATCH_SIZE=64\n\n2. Make sure to use a 1.5B parameter model by setting appropriate HIDDEN_SIZE, LAYERS, and other model parameters in the script.\n\n3. Configure the script to use 8 GPUs by setting PIPELINE_SIZE=8 and TP_SIZE=1.\n\n4. Run the script with: bash examples/test_all_schedules.sh\n\n5. The script will automatically test all the required scheduling methods (1F1B, 1F1B-I as 'interleaved', ZB-1p as 'zb', and ZB-2p as 'zbv') and log the throughput results in the logs directory.\n\n6. After running the experiments with different microbatch settings, analyze the logs to compare throughput across methods and microbatch counts.",
