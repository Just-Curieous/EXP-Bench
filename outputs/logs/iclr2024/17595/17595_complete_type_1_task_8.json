      "question": "Is setting the memory limit to approximately 2pMB sufficient to achieve a near-zero bubble rate, and do further increments in Mlimit yield diminishing improvements?",
      "method": "Design an experiment to evaluate the impact of varying Mlimit configurations under the condition that TF \u2248 TB and Tcomm is relatively small. Specifically, run experiments on a fixed model setup such as a 14.6B model with p = 16 and using microbatch settings of 48, 64, or 128, or on a 28.3B model with p = 32 and microbatch options like 96, 128, or 256. Use at least three different memory limit settings: one below the empirically observed threshold (e.g., 1.5pMB), one at the threshold (2pMB), and one above the threshold (e.g., 2.5pMB or 3pMB). Ensure that all other system conditions remain identical throughout the experiments. For each memory limit configuration, run the pipeline scheduling algorithm multiple times to capture variability in the bubble rate. The bubble rate should be measured and compared across configurations to assess whether the 2pMB limit produces an empirically near-zero bubble rate and if increasing the memory limit further leads to diminishing improvements. Reference trends and analyses similar to those documented in relevant figures and tables as outlined in the experimental setup without revealing the actual results.",
      "expected_outcome": "The expectation is that setting Mlimit to around 2pMB will produce an empirically near-zero bubble rate under the specified conditions, confirming that additional memory beyond this threshold results in diminishing improvements. While a theoretically zero bubble rate may be achieved with very high memory limits, the gain in reducing bubbles should be minimal compared to the extra resource cost. The results should mirror the presented trends in Figure 7 and consistent bubble rate values as detailed in Table 5, confirming that the performance (throughput nearing the upper bound) is maximized at the 2pMB configuration.",

Specifically:\n\n1. Create a custom methods array with different memory limit configurations:\n   ```bash\n   methods=(\n       \"zb-1.5p\"\n       \"zb-2p\"\n       \"zb-2.5p\"\n       \"zb-3p\"\n   )\n   ```\n\n2. Add corresponding conditions in the if-elif block:\n   ```bash\n   if [ $method == \"zb-1.5p\" ]; then\n       export ENABLE_ZERO_BUBBLE=1\n       export ZERO_BUBBLE_MEM_LIMIT=$((15 * $PIPELINE_SIZE / 10))\n   elif [ $method == \"zb-2p\" ]; then\n       export ENABLE_ZERO_BUBBLE=1\n       export ZERO_BUBBLE_MEM_LIMIT=$((2 * $PIPELINE_SIZE))\n   elif [ $method == \"zb-2.5p\" ]; then\n       export ENABLE_ZERO_BUBBLE=1\n       export ZERO_BUBBLE_MEM_LIMIT=$((25 * $PIPELINE_SIZE / 10))\n   elif [ $method == \"zb-3p\" ]; then\n       export ENABLE_ZERO_BUBBLE=1\n       export ZERO_BUBBLE_MEM_LIMIT=$((3 * $PIPELINE_SIZE))\n   fi\n   ```\n\n3.

Set the appropriate microbatch size as specified (48, 64, or 128 for the 14.6B model; 96, 128, or 256 for the 28.3B model).\n\n5. Execute the script, which will run the pipeline scheduling algorithm multiple times with different memory limit configurations.\n\n6. After execution, analyze the logs in the ${LOGS_DIR}/$run/ directory to compare bubble rates across different memory limit configurations.",
