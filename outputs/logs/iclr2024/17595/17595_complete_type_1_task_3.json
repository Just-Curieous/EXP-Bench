      "question": "For larger model scales (28.3B model on 32 GPUs), does the trend of ZB-2p nearing upper-bound throughput and outperforming conventional scheduling methods (1F1B, 1F1B-I, and ZB-1p) hold even as the microbatch count varies? Specifically, can we observe that the throughput of ZB-2p remains consistently close to the ideal upper bound (defined as the computation-only throughput adjusted by the bubble rate) across different microbatch counts (e.g., 96, 128, and 256), compared to the throughput gains of the other methods?",
      "method": "Configure experiments with a 28.3B parameter model on 32 NVIDIA A100 SXM 80G GPUs distributed across 4 nodes connected via a RoCE RDMA network. Use microbatch counts of 96, 128, and 256 as specified in the related tables and figures. Implement and compare four scheduling methods: 1F1B, 1F1B-I, ZB-1p, and ZB-2p. When implementing the ZB schedules, ensure that the appropriate command line flags are used to control the pipeline scheduling behavior. For example, according to the repository\u2019s guidelines, setting '--zero-bubble-max-pending-backward' to 1\u00d7 the number of pipelines yields a schedule like ZB-1p and to 2\u00d7 yields ZB-2p. Additionally, use the '--enable-zero-bubble' and '--zero-bubble-v-schedule' flags (or related flags) as needed to enable zero bubble scheduling. Collect detailed empirical measurements of computation times (TF, TB, TW) and communication times (Tcomm) as described, and use these to compute the estimated upper bound throughput (computed as m*(TF+TB+TW) with full overlap assumptions) and bubble rates (as outlined in the associated experimental tables). Record throughput in samples per second per GPU and memory usage per experiment. Use the Megatron-LM implementation with a fixed random seed for reproducibility and verify the bit-to-bit equivalence of loss outputs across methods. Refer to the experimental details discussed in the paper (including data found in Tables 3, 4, and 9 as well as Figure 5) to guide the comparative analysis.",
      "expected_outcome": "The experimental results should demonstrate that for the 28.3B model on 32 GPUs, ZB-2p consistently achieves throughput near the upper bound, maintaining high performance with low bubble rates (typically less than 1%) across all tested microbatch counts. In contrast, while throughput for methods such as 1F1B and 1F1B-I may show increases as the microbatch count increases, they will not reach the near-optimal throughput observed with ZB-2p. Detailed comparative data from the related tables and figures should quantitatively support the observation that ZB-2p outperforms the other scheduling methods in terms of both throughput efficiency and memory usage.",
