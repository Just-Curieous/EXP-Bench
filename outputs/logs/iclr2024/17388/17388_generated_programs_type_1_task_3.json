    "usage_instructions": "To compare vicuna-13b and llama-2-13b performance within the AGENT BENCH framework, follow these steps:\n\n1. First, ensure both models are properly configured in the fs_agent.yaml file. The vicuna-13b configuration already exists, but you may need to add llama-2-13b configuration.\n\n2. Create a custom assignment configuration file (e.g., 'configs/assignments/model_comparison.yaml') with the following content:\n```yaml\nimport: definition.yaml\n\nconcurrency:\n  task:\n    dbbench-std: 5\n    os-std: 5\n    kg-std: 5\n    ltp-std: 5\n    alfworld-std: 5\n    mind2web-std: 5\n    webshop-std: 5\n    card_game-std: 5\n  agent:\n    vicuna-13b: 5\n    llama-2-13b: 5\n\nassignments:\n  - agent:\n      - vicuna-13b\n      - llama-2-13b\n    task:\n      - dbbench-std\n      - os-std\n      - kg-std\n      - ltp-std\n      - alfworld-std\n      - mind2web-std\n      - webshop-std\n      - card_game-std\n\noutput: \"outputs/model_comparison_{TIMESTAMP}\"\n```\n\n3. Start the task servers for all environments:\n```bash\npython -m src.start_task -a\n```\n\n4. Run the assigner with the custom configuration:\n```bash\npython -m src.assigner --config configs/assignments/model_comparison.yaml\n```\n\n5. After the evaluation is complete, analyze the results using the analysis.py script:\n```bash\npython -m src.analysis --config configs/assignments/model_comparison.yaml --output outputs/model_comparison_* --save analysis_results\n```\n\n6. The analysis results will be saved in the 'analysis_results' directory, including:\n   - summary.csv: Contains the main metrics for each model across all tasks\n   - agent_validation.csv: Contains validation statistics for each model, including error rates\n   - task_validation.csv: Contains validation statistics for each task\n\nThese files will provide comprehensive data on how vicuna-13b and llama-2-13b compare in terms of overall performance, planning ability, self-correction, and error rates (invalid action, invalid format, and Task Limit Exceeded occurrences)."
