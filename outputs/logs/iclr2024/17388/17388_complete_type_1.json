Calculate the correlation coefficient (e.g., Pearson\u2019s r) to quantify this relationship. Additionally, perform regression analyses (including possible polynomial regression) to determine whether the trend is strictly linear or if there are diminishing returns as model size increases. For further context, compare these findings with API-based LLMs (noting that the average API-based score is around 2.15 versus 0.51 for OSS LLMs) and, where applicable, incorporate insights from Table 4 regarding different execution outcomes (e.g., TLE, Invalid Format) to understand if error types impact performance trends.",
