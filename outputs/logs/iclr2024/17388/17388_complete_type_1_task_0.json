      "hypothesis": "Do API-based LLMs consistently outperform open-sourced LLMs across different tasks on the AGENT BENCH benchmark? Specifically, does the trend observed in Table 3\u2014where API-based LLMs (e.g., gpt-4, gpt-3.5-turbo) show overall scores above 1.00, and models like gpt-4 achieve high success rates (e.g., 78% in House Holding)\u2014hold across varying execution outcomes as detailed in Table 4?",
      "method": "Collect and analyze performance results from Table 3, which reports dataset-specific scores and overall AGENT BENCH scores, and Table 4, which details breakdowns of execution outcomes (Completed, Context Limit Exceeded, Invalid Format, Invalid Action, and Task Limit Exceeded). Compare the performance of API-based LLMs with open-sourced LLMs using metrics such as average scores (e.g., API-based LLM average around 2.15 vs. OSS average around 0.51), success rates in specific tasks (e.g., House Holding), and error distributions. Incorporate additional supporting details and visual cues from the figures if available, ensuring consistency with the reported metrics and error categorizations.",
      "expected_outcome": "It is expected that API-based LLMs will significantly outperform open-sourced LLMs across most evaluated tasks. Models like gpt-4 should demonstrate superior performance with high success rates and lower error occurrences, as evidenced by overall AGENT BENCH scores and detailed execution outcome breakdowns. The results from Table 3 and Table 4 should collectively confirm the robustness and effectiveness of commercial models relative to OSS alternatives.",

Load a configuration file that defines available agents (LLMs) and tasks.\n\n3. Process benchmark results by:\n   - Walking through the output directory to find result files (overall.json)\n   - Organizing results by agent and task\n   - Mapping model names to standardized display names\n   - Filtering results by timestamp if specified\n\n4.
