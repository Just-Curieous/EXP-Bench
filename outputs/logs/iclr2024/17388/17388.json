            "hypothesis": "Do API-based LLMs consistently outperform open-sourced LLMs across different tasks on the AGENT BENCH benchmark? Specifically, does the trend observed in Table 3\u2014where API-based LLMs (e.g., gpt-4, gpt-3.5-turbo) show overall scores above 1.00, and models like gpt-4 achieve high success rates (e.g., 78% in House Holding)\u2014hold across varying execution outcomes as detailed in Table 4?",
            "method": "Collect and analyze performance results from Table 3, which reports dataset-specific scores and overall AGENT BENCH scores, and Table 4, which details breakdowns of execution outcomes (Completed, Context Limit Exceeded, Invalid Format, Invalid Action, and Task Limit Exceeded). Compare the performance of API-based LLMs with open-sourced LLMs using metrics such as average scores (e.g., API-based LLM average around 2.15 vs. OSS average around 0.51), success rates in specific tasks (e.g., House Holding), and error distributions. Incorporate additional supporting details and visual cues from the figures if available, ensuring consistency with the reported metrics and error categorizations.",
            "expected_outcome": "It is expected that API-based LLMs will significantly outperform open-sourced LLMs across most evaluated tasks. Models like gpt-4 should demonstrate superior performance with high success rates and lower error occurrences, as evidenced by overall AGENT BENCH scores and detailed execution outcome breakdowns. The results from Table 3 and Table 4 should collectively confirm the robustness and effectiveness of commercial models relative to OSS alternatives.",

        {
            "hypothesis": "Is there a positive correlation between the size (in billions of parameters) of OSS LLMs and their overall AGENT BENCH score, and does the relationship exhibit diminishing returns or non-linear trends at higher parameter scales?",
            "method": "Extract the parameter sizes and corresponding overall AGENT BENCH scores for OSS LLMs as depicted in Figure 3. Use data points from models such as codellama-34b (OA score of 0.96) among others to construct a scatter plot with model size on the x-axis and overall score on the y-axis. Calculate the correlation coefficient (e.g., Pearson\u2019s r) to quantify this relationship. Additionally, perform regression analyses (including possible polynomial regression) to determine whether the trend is strictly linear or if there are diminishing returns as model size increases. For further context, compare these findings with API-based LLMs (noting that the average API-based score is around 2.15 versus 0.51 for OSS LLMs) and, where applicable, incorporate insights from Table 4 regarding different execution outcomes (e.g., TLE, Invalid Format) to understand if error types impact performance trends.",
            "expected_outcome": "A moderate to strong positive correlation is expected, indicating that larger OSS LLMs tend to achieve better overall scores on AGENT BENCH. However, the analysis may reveal diminishing returns for models with very large parameter counts, and even the top-performing OSS LLMs are likely to show a noticeable performance gap compared to API-based LLMs. This suggests that additional factors beyond model size, such as training methods or fine-tuning strategies, significantly influence overall performance.",

            "hypothesis": "Does code tuning in LLMs improve performance on tasks with well-defined, static procedures (e.g., Web Shopping) while potentially undermining performance on tasks that demand more general reasoning (e.g., Digital Card Game and Operating System interactions)?",
            "method": "Select two groups of models from the paper\u2019s evaluation: one with code tuning (e.g., the CodeLlama series) and one without (e.g., the Llama-2 series). Identify and group AGENT BENCH tasks into two categories: tasks following fixed, static procedures (e.g., Web Shopping) and tasks requiring flexible, general decision-making (e.g., Digital Card Game and Operating System interactions). For each model, execute the full task suite under identical settings (same dataset splits, inference parameters, and prompt templates). Record key metrics such as success rate (SR), invalid action (IA) errors, invalid format (IF) errors, and task limit exceeded (TLE) outcomes. Leverage the detailed breakdown provided in Table 2 (which includes the number of rounds, sample sizes, and task weightings) and Table 4 (which reports ratios of execution outcomes, highlighting prevalent error types) to inform statistical analysis. Additionally, incorporate insights from Figure 10, which presents the averaged sample validity ratios for the Web Shopping task, to provide visual support for performance differences. Statistically compare the performances of the two groups across both task categories to determine whether code tuning advantages static procedures while impairing general reasoning capabilities.",
            "expected_outcome": "It is anticipated that code-tuned models will excel on tasks that require following a static and well-defined procedure, as evidenced by higher success rates and lower incidences of invalid action and format errors (supported by metrics from Table 2 and Table 4, and visualized in Figure 10). Conversely, these models are expected to underperform on tasks demanding broader reasoning and flexible decision-making (such as Digital Card Game and Operating System interactions), thereby confirming the ambivalent impact of code tuning observed in the evaluation.",

            "hypothesis": "Does training with high-quality alignment data (as used for vicuna-13b) lead to significantly better agent performance compared to models aligned from scratch (e.g., llama-2-13b), particularly in terms of planning, self-correction, and instruction following? We also hypothesize that the performance gains may manifest not only in overall scores but also in reduced error rates such as invalid action and invalid format occurrences, as detailed in AGENT BENCH's breakdown (see Table 4).",
            "method": "Directly compare the performance of vicuna-13b and llama-2-13b within the AGENT BENCH framework under identical evaluation conditions, including the same task prompts, inference settings (with temperature set to 0 for reproducibility), and datasets across diverse environments. Specifically, measure overall scores and error-specific metrics (invalid action, invalid format, and Task Limit Exceeded occurrences) as outlined in AGENT BENCH. Additionally, include comparisons against larger models (e.g., codellama-34b) to provide context on performance enhancement due to high-quality alignment. Analyze the differences in planning ability, self-correction, token distribution, and multi-round decision-making as reflected in the execution outcomes reported (e.g., detailed in Table 4). Incorporate insights from Figures and additional tables where possible to capture nuanced performance metrics such as distribution of tokens and rounds in completed trajectories.",
            "expected_outcome": "The experiment should demonstrate that vicuna-13b outperforms llama-2-13b by achieving higher overall scores and lower error rates, including fewer invalid action and invalid format errors and reduced Task Limit Exceeded occurrences. In certain cases, the performance of vicuna-13b may approach that of models approximately three times its size. This would support the claim that high-quality alignment data is a key driver for enhanced LLM agent performance, and offer insights into improved planning ability and self-correction mechanisms.",

            "hypothesis": "Does increasing model size (as in comparing llama-2-70b to llama-2-13b) necessarily yield improved performance, or can insufficient pre-training and a lack of refined alignment negate the benefits of a larger parameter count?",
            "method": "Run a controlled experiment comparing llama-2-70b and llama-2-13b across the complete set of AGENT BENCH task environments. Both models should be evaluated using identical prompt formatting, an inference temperature of 0 (greedy decoding), and identical task splits. In addition to overall scoring, pay close attention to tasks that demand strong reasoning and precise adherence to instructions. Collect and analyze detailed outcome distributions, including error types such as Task Limit Exceeded (TLE), Invalid Format, and Invalid Action errors, as detailed in Table 4. Incorporate relevant details from other tables where appropriate, and apply the post-processing protocol for non-chat models (e.g., prefixing 'USER:' and 'AGENT:' for text completion models). Ensure repeatability by performing multiple runs to check for consistency and re-run experiments to rule out statistical anomalies.",
            "expected_outcome": "It is anticipated that both models may show similar performance levels despite the large discrepancy in parameter count. This would suggest that the larger llama-2-70b does not necessarily outperform the smaller llama-2-13b, potentially due to shortcomings in pre-training token volume and less refined instruction-following alignment. Detailed error breakdowns (e.g., the proportions of TLE, Invalid Format, and Invalid Action errors as shown in Table 4) will provide additional insight into the specific areas where increased size might fail to translate into improved performance.",
