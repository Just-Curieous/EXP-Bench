      "hypothesis": "Does training with high-quality alignment data (as used for vicuna-13b) lead to significantly better agent performance compared to models aligned from scratch (e.g., llama-2-13b), particularly in terms of planning, self-correction, and instruction following? We also hypothesize that the performance gains may manifest not only in overall scores but also in reduced error rates such as invalid action and invalid format occurrences, as detailed in AGENT BENCH's breakdown (see Table 4).",
      "method": "Directly compare the performance of vicuna-13b and llama-2-13b within the AGENT BENCH framework under identical evaluation conditions, including the same task prompts, inference settings (with temperature set to 0 for reproducibility), and datasets across diverse environments. Specifically, measure overall scores and error-specific metrics (invalid action, invalid format, and Task Limit Exceeded occurrences) as outlined in AGENT BENCH. Additionally, include comparisons against larger models (e.g., codellama-34b) to provide context on performance enhancement due to high-quality alignment. Analyze the differences in planning ability, self-correction, token distribution, and multi-round decision-making as reflected in the execution outcomes reported (e.g., detailed in Table 4). Incorporate insights from Figures and additional tables where possible to capture nuanced performance metrics such as distribution of tokens and rounds in completed trajectories.",
      "expected_outcome": "The experiment should demonstrate that vicuna-13b outperforms llama-2-13b by achieving higher overall scores and lower error rates, including fewer invalid action and invalid format errors and reduced Task Limit Exceeded occurrences. In certain cases, the performance of vicuna-13b may approach that of models approximately three times its size. This would support the claim that high-quality alignment data is a key driver for enhanced LLM agent performance, and offer insights into improved planning ability and self-correction mechanisms.",

      "usage_instructions": "To compare vicuna-13b and llama-2-13b performance within the AGENT BENCH framework, follow these steps:\n\n1. First, ensure both models are properly configured in the fs_agent.yaml file. The vicuna-13b configuration already exists, but you may need to add llama-2-13b configuration.\n\n2. Create a custom assignment configuration file (e.g., 'configs/assignments/model_comparison.yaml') with the following content:\n```yaml\nimport: definition.yaml\n\nconcurrency:\n  task:\n    dbbench-std: 5\n    os-std: 5\n    kg-std: 5\n    ltp-std: 5\n    alfworld-std: 5\n    mind2web-std: 5\n    webshop-std: 5\n    card_game-std: 5\n  agent:\n    vicuna-13b: 5\n    llama-2-13b: 5\n\nassignments:\n  - agent:\n      - vicuna-13b\n      - llama-2-13b\n    task:\n      - dbbench-std\n      - os-std\n      - kg-std\n      - ltp-std\n      - alfworld-std\n      - mind2web-std\n      - webshop-std\n      - card_game-std\n\noutput: \"outputs/model_comparison_{TIMESTAMP}\"\n```\n\n3. Start the task servers for all environments:\n```bash\npython -m src.start_task -a\n```\n\n4. Run the assigner with the custom configuration:\n```bash\npython -m src.assigner --config configs/assignments/model_comparison.yaml\n```\n\n5. After the evaluation is complete, analyze the results using the analysis.py script:\n```bash\npython -m src.analysis --config configs/assignments/model_comparison.yaml --output outputs/model_comparison_* --save analysis_results\n```\n\n6. The analysis results will be saved in the 'analysis_results' directory, including:\n   - summary.csv: Contains the main metrics for each model across all tasks\n   - agent_validation.csv: Contains validation statistics for each model, including error rates\n   - task_validation.csv: Contains validation statistics for each task\n\nThese files will provide comprehensive data on how vicuna-13b and llama-2-13b compare in terms of overall performance, planning ability, self-correction, and error rates (invalid action, invalid format, and Task Limit Exceeded occurrences).",
