                    "score_explanation": "The paper introduces AgentBench for evaluating LLMs as agents, but the task is focused on creating a custom HTTP-based agent. The core component involves implementing a new agent class that inherits from the AgentClient base class, which is a new logic required by the task. This core component is clearly specified in Step 1 of the method. All other components, such as initializing the agent, handling conversation history, implementing error handling, creating configuration files, registering the agent, and testing the implementation, are orchestration tasks that support the experiment execution but do not involve implementing the novel contribution of the paper. These non-core components are clearly defined, with no ambiguity in their implementation requirements."
