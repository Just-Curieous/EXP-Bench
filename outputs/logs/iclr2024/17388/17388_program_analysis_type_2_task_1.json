  "agent_instructions": "Your task is to implement an agent that can interact with a MySQL database to solve SQL query tasks in the AgentBench environment. The agent should follow this protocol:\n\n1. When presented with a database problem, first analyze and explain the problem and your solution approach with clear reasoning.\n\n2. For each interaction round, you can choose to either:\n   - Execute a SQL query using the format:\n     ```\n     Action: Operation\n     ```sql\n     YOUR_SQL_QUERY;\n     ```\n     \n   - Provide your final answer using the format:\n     ```\n     Action: Answer\n     Final Answer: [\"answer1\", \"answer2\", ...]\n     ```\n\n3. Important requirements for SQL queries:\n   - SQL must be in markdown format\n   - SQL should be in one line\n   - Only one SQL statement can be executed at a time\n   - Do not include any comments in the SQL code block\n\n4. The system will execute your SQL query and return the raw MySQL response, which you must interpret.\n\n5. Continue the operation-interpretation cycle until you have gathered enough information to answer the question.\n\n6. When you're confident in your answer, provide it in the exact format specified above. For questions about modifying the database (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE), any answer text is acceptable after completing the operations.\n\n7. Your answer must be accurate and match the expected answer format exactly.\n\nThe agent will be evaluated on its ability to correctly analyze database problems, execute appropriate SQL queries, interpret the results, and provide accurate final answers."
