  "agent_instructions": "Your task is to implement a speech recognition system using the Transducer architecture on the yesno dataset and compare its performance with the TDNN-CTC model. Follow these steps:\n\n1. Create a Transducer model architecture with three components:\n   - Encoder: A TDNN (Time Delay Neural Network) that processes input audio features\n   - Decoder: An LSTM-based network that processes prediction history\n   - Joiner: A network that combines encoder and decoder outputs\n\n2. The model should use the RNN-T loss function from torchaudio for training.\n\n3. For the yesno dataset:\n   - It's a simple dataset with only \"YES\" and \"NO\" words\n   - The vocabulary consists of 3 tokens: blank, YES, and NO\n   - Use appropriate data loading and preprocessing\n\n4. Implement the training process:\n   - Set up appropriate hyperparameters\n   - Include validation during training\n   - Use gradient clipping to stabilize training\n   - Save checkpoints of the model\n\n5. Implement decoding using greedy search to convert model outputs to word sequences.\n\n6. Evaluate the model on the test set:\n   - Calculate Word Error Rate (WER)\n   - Save the transcription results\n   - Generate detailed error statistics\n\n7. Compare the performance of your Transducer model with the TDNN-CTC model:\n   - Compare accuracy (WER)\n   - Compare efficiency (training time, inference time)\n   - Analyze the strengths and weaknesses of each approach\n\nThe goal is to achieve comparable or better performance than the TDNN-CTC model on this dataset."
