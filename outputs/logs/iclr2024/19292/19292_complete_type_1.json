      "hypothesis": "Based on the ablation study reported in Table 5, removing the temporal downsampling structure from Zipformer-M is expected to increase the number of model parameters significantly (from 65.6M to 94.2M) and lead to a degradation in performance. In particular, while the Word Error Rates (WERs) are only slightly higher (e.g., test-clean WER may increase from 2.21% to 2.23% and test-other WER from 4.79% to 5.09%), this confirms that the temporal downsampling is crucial for maintaining an efficient modeling capacity without loss of information.",
      "method": "Train the baseline Zipformer-M model on the LibriSpeech dataset using the comprehensive training pipeline as outlined in the paper: precompute 80-dimensional Mel filter-bank features (25ms frames with a 10ms shift), apply dynamic bucketing using the Lhotse toolkit, and augment the data via speed perturbation (factors 0.9, 1.0, and 1.1) and SpecAugment. Use mixed precision training together with activation constraints such as Balancer and Whitener for training stability. Then, create a modified variant by removing the temporal downsampling component from the encoder. Replace this component with a Conv-Embed module that applies a downsampling rate of 4 (following the approach used in Conformer), ensuring that all other hyperparameters, epoch counts, GPU allocation, and training schedules remain constant. After training, evaluate both the baseline and modified models on the LibriSpeech test-clean and test-other sets, and compare the absolute WER values, referring to the ablation results in Table 5.",
      "expected_outcome": "The model variant without temporal downsampling is expected to have an increased parameter count (approximately 94.2M compared to the baseline 65.6M) and exhibit a slight degradation in performance with increased WERs\u2014around 2.23% on test-clean and 5.09% on test-other. This outcome would validate the importance of the temporal downsampling structure in maintaining efficient modeling capacity without incurring significant information loss.",

      "hypothesis": "Using the tailored Swoosh activation functions\u2014specifically applying SwooshL for normally-off modules such as those with bypass connections, and applying SwooshR for convolution modules and embedding layers\u2014will yield more stable training dynamics and lower overall WER compared to uniformly using the standard Swish activation function. This hypothesis is supported by improvements noted in Table 5 where the tailored activation (with SwooshR and implied SwooshL for normally-off modules) results in lower WER (e.g., a drop of approximately 0.42% on the test-other set) relative to using Swish everywhere, as well as the activation properties summarized in Table 3.",
      "method": "Create two versions of the Zipformer-M model. In Version A, replace the activation functions with a tailored combination: use SwooshL for modules featuring bypass connections (normally-off modules) and SwooshR for convolution modules and embedding layers. In Version B, use Swish uniformly across all modules. Train both models on the LibriSpeech dataset under identical conditions\u2014including the same number of epochs, optimizer settings (e.g., using ScaledAdam as detailed in Tables 1 and 2 with adjusted learning rate bases), GPU setup, and data augmentation techniques such as speed perturbation factors of 0.9, 1.0, and 1.1 (as described in Table 7). Include the use of the Balancer and the Whitener mechanisms to regulate activation gradients during backpropagation. Monitor detailed training dynamics such as activation gradient patterns (as illustrated in Figure A.3) and bias behavior in linear layers preceding the bypass connections. Finally, evaluate both models on test-clean and test-other sets, comparing the final WER values to the benchmarks provided in Table 5.",
      "expected_outcome": "It is expected that the tailored Swoosh configuration will demonstrate more stable training dynamics and yield lower WER values relative to the Swish-only configuration. Specifically, improvements might manifest as a marginal WER reduction\u2014such as a decrease of around 0.42% on the test-other set\u2014and possibly a slightly lower WER on the test-clean set, as suggested by the trends observed in Table 5. The enhanced control over activation gradients and feature covariance (aided by the Balancer and Whitener) is also expected to contribute to a more robust training process.",

      "no_answer": "After thoroughly exploring the repository, I could not find a specific script or set of scripts that directly answer the experiment question about comparing tailored Swoosh activation functions (SwooshL for bypass connections and SwooshR for convolution modules) versus uniform Swish activation. While the codebase does contain implementations of both Swoosh (SwooshL and SwooshR) and Swish activation functions, and the Zipformer model in /workspace/egs/librispeech/ASR/zipformer/ already uses SwooshL and SwooshR in different parts of the model, there is no dedicated script that allows for a direct comparison between these activation strategies as described in the experiment question. The existing implementation would need to be modified to create a version that uses Swish uniformly across all modules, and there is no straightforward configuration parameter or flag to make this change without modifying the source code."

      "hypothesis": "Employing the ScaledAdam optimizer, which leverages parameter scale information to dynamically adjust learning rates and momentum terms, will lead to faster convergence and lower final Word Error Rate (WER) compared to training with the standard Adam optimizer.",
      "method": "Set up two training regimes for the Zipformer-M ASR model on the LibriSpeech dataset. For the first regime, use ScaledAdam with a base learning rate factor (\u03b1_base) of 0.045 and update parameters using both the gradient moments and the parameter-scale moments (nt and wt, as detailed in Equation 7). For the second regime, use the standard Adam optimizer with a base learning rate factor of 7.5 and follow the learning rate schedule \u03b1_t = \u03b1_base \u00b7 512^(\u20130.5) \u00b7 min(t^(\u20130.5), t * 10000^(\u20131.5)) according to the reference (Gulati et al., 2020). Use the same Zipformer-M architecture comprising 6 encoder stacks (with attention heads set to {4,4,4,8,4,4} and convolution kernel sizes {31,31,15,15,15,31}) and consistent feed-forward module dimensions. Ensure both setups run under identical hardware conditions and data augmentation schemes for the same number of epochs. Monitor and record training loss, convergence speed by charting both the learning rate progression (as illustrated in Figure A.2) and loss curves, and evaluate performance using WER on test-clean and test-other sets. Incorporate additional details from ablation studies (e.g., Table 5) to compare how optimizer choice influences performance outcomes.",
      "expected_outcome": "Based on previous ablation studies, the ScaledAdam optimizer is expected to outperform Adam by reducing the WER by approximately 0.17% on the test-clean set and 0.72% on the test-other set. Additionally, training with ScaledAdam should display faster convergence rates and smoother loss curves as a result of its adaptive scaling mechanism.",

      "no_answer": "After a thorough search of the repository, I couldn't find a specific script or set of scripts that directly answers the experiment question comparing ScaledAdam and Adam optimizers for the Zipformer-M ASR model on LibriSpeech. The repository uses ScaledAdam as the default optimizer in the zipformer training script (/workspace/egs/librispeech/ASR/zipformer/train.py), but there's no built-in functionality to switch to Adam with the specific learning rate schedule mentioned in the experiment question. While it would be possible to modify the training script to use Adam instead of ScaledAdam, this would require more extensive code changes than just changing a flag or parameter, and would need testing to ensure it runs correctly."

      "hypothesis": "The specific block structure of Zipformer (with its unique modules such as NLA, bypass, and attention weights sharing) is crucial for achieving optimal performance. Replacing these components with alternative structures\u2014such as stacking two Conformer-style blocks or removing the NLA module or the attention weights sharing mechanism\u2014will degrade performance. Ablation studies from Table 5 indicate that modifications like removing temporal downsampling or key modules lead to higher word error rates, thereby underlining the importance of each component within the proposed block design.",
      "method": "Design an experiment using the Zipformer-M model as a base, following the same training conditions as in the original study (i.e., training on the LibriSpeech dataset for 50 epochs using 4 GPUs, with the same optimizer and hyperparameters). Construct several variants: (a) replace each Zipformer block with a pair of stacked Conformer blocks (referencing the 'Double Conformer-style blocks' variant in Table 5), (b) remove the Non-linear Activation (NLA) module (as in the 'NoNLA' variant), (c) remove both the NLA module and the attention weights sharing mechanism (as in the 'NoNLA, no attention weights sharing' variant), and (d) remove the bypass connection (as in the 'NoBypass' variant). For each variant, train the model and evaluate its performance on both the test-clean and test-other sets. In addition to tracking the word error rates (baseline reported as 65.6 / 2.21 / 4.79 for Zipformer-M), document the number of parameters and the inference speed. This detailed experimental setup, drawing from results presented in Table 5 and incorporating standard training configurations, will allow for a thorough comparison against the baseline.",
      "expected_outcome": "It is expected that the baseline Zipformer-M model will outperform all modified variants. Specifically, the baseline (with its integrated NLA, bypass, and attention weights sharing) should achieve the best performance with a word error rate of approximately 65.6 on test-clean, 2.21 on one evaluation metric, and 4.79 on test-other. Although a slight variation in results (for example, a marginal improvement in certain metrics with double Conformer-style blocks on test-other) might occur, overall, removing or altering key components\u2014such as NLA or bypass\u2014will result in noticeable performance degradation. The outcome of these experiments will support the conclusion that each component of the novel block structure contributes significantly to the overall performance.",
