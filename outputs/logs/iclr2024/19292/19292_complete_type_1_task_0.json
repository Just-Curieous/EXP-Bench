      "hypothesis": "Based on the ablation study reported in Table 5, removing the temporal downsampling structure from Zipformer-M is expected to increase the number of model parameters significantly (from 65.6M to 94.2M) and lead to a degradation in performance. In particular, while the Word Error Rates (WERs) are only slightly higher (e.g., test-clean WER may increase from 2.21% to 2.23% and test-other WER from 4.79% to 5.09%), this confirms that the temporal downsampling is crucial for maintaining an efficient modeling capacity without loss of information.",
      "method": "Train the baseline Zipformer-M model on the LibriSpeech dataset using the comprehensive training pipeline as outlined in the paper: precompute 80-dimensional Mel filter-bank features (25ms frames with a 10ms shift), apply dynamic bucketing using the Lhotse toolkit, and augment the data via speed perturbation (factors 0.9, 1.0, and 1.1) and SpecAugment. Use mixed precision training together with activation constraints such as Balancer and Whitener for training stability. Then, create a modified variant by removing the temporal downsampling component from the encoder. Replace this component with a Conv-Embed module that applies a downsampling rate of 4 (following the approach used in Conformer), ensuring that all other hyperparameters, epoch counts, GPU allocation, and training schedules remain constant. After training, evaluate both the baseline and modified models on the LibriSpeech test-clean and test-other sets, and compare the absolute WER values, referring to the ablation results in Table 5.",
      "expected_outcome": "The model variant without temporal downsampling is expected to have an increased parameter count (approximately 94.2M compared to the baseline 65.6M) and exhibit a slight degradation in performance with increased WERs\u2014around 2.23% on test-clean and 5.09% on test-other. This outcome would validate the importance of the temporal downsampling structure in maintaining efficient modeling capacity without incurring significant information loss.",

      "usage_instructions": "To run the experiment comparing Zipformer-M with and without temporal downsampling:\n\n1. First, train the baseline Zipformer-M model with temporal downsampling (this is the default configuration):\n\nexport CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=\"0,1,2,3\"\n./zipformer/train.py \\\n  --world-size 4 \\\n  --num-epochs 50 \\\n  --start-epoch 1 \\\n  --use-fp16 1 \\\n  --exp-dir zipformer/exp-baseline \\\n  --full-libri 1 \\\n  --max-duration 1000\n\n2. Then, train the modified Zipformer-M model without temporal downsampling by setting all downsampling factors to 1:\n\nexport CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=\"0,1,2,3\"\n./zipformer/train.py \\\n  --world-size 4 \\\n  --num-epochs 50 \\\n  --start-epoch 1 \\\n  --use-fp16 1 \\\n  --exp-dir zipformer/exp-no-downsampling \\\n  --full-libri 1 \\\n  --max-duration 1000 \\\n  --downsampling-factor \"1,1,1,1,1,1\"\n\n3.
