    "no_answer": "After thoroughly exploring the repository, I could not find a specific script or set of scripts that directly answer the experiment question about comparing tailored Swoosh activation functions (SwooshL for bypass connections and SwooshR for convolution modules) versus uniform Swish activation. While the codebase does contain implementations of both Swoosh (SwooshL and SwooshR) and Swish activation functions, and the Zipformer model in /workspace/egs/librispeech/ASR/zipformer/ already uses SwooshL and SwooshR in different parts of the model, there is no dedicated script that allows for a direct comparison between these activation strategies as described in the experiment question. The existing implementation would need to be modified to create a version that uses Swish uniformly across all modules, and there is no straightforward configuration parameter or flag to make this change without modifying the source code."
