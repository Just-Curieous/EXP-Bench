  "agent_instructions": "Your task is to implement a Time Delay Neural Network (TDNN) model for speech recognition on the yesno dataset that achieves a Word Error Rate (WER) of less than 1%. Follow these steps:\n\n1. Create a TDNN model architecture:\n   - Implement a PyTorch model with three Conv1d layers\n   - Each Conv1d layer should be followed by ReLU activation and BatchNorm\n   - Add a final linear layer that outputs log probabilities for phoneme classes\n   - The model should take audio features as input and output log probabilities\n\n2. Set up data processing for the yesno dataset:\n   - Create a data module to load and preprocess the yesno dataset\n   - Extract 23-dimensional fbank features from the audio files\n   - Split the data into training and testing sets\n\n3. Implement the training process:\n   - Use CTC loss for training the model\n   - Set up an SGD optimizer with appropriate learning rate (around 1e-2)\n   - Train the model for sufficient epochs (around 15) to achieve convergence\n   - Save checkpoints and track the best model based on validation loss\n\n4. Implement decoding and evaluation:\n   - Create a decoding function that converts model outputs to word sequences\n   - Use k2's one_best_decoding for finding the best path\n   - Evaluate the model on the test set and calculate Word Error Rate (WER)\n   - Report the WER and verify it is less than 1%\n\nThe yesno dataset consists of recordings of someone saying 'yes' or 'no' in various combinations. Your goal is to train a model that can accurately recognize these words with a WER of less than 1%."
