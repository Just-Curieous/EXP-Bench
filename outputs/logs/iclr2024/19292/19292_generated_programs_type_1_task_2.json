    "no_answer": "After a thorough search of the repository, I couldn't find a specific script or set of scripts that directly answers the experiment question comparing ScaledAdam and Adam optimizers for the Zipformer-M ASR model on LibriSpeech. The repository uses ScaledAdam as the default optimizer in the zipformer training script (/workspace/egs/librispeech/ASR/zipformer/train.py), but there's no built-in functionality to switch to Adam with the specific learning rate schedule mentioned in the experiment question. While it would be possible to modify the training script to use Adam instead of ScaledAdam, this would require more extensive code changes than just changing a flag or parameter, and would need testing to ensure it runs correctly."
