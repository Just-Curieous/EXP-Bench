    "no_answer": "After a thorough search of the repository, I could not find specific scripts that directly implement the ablation studies mentioned in the experiment question. The repository contains the implementation of the Zipformer model in /workspace/egs/librispeech/ASR/zipformer/zipformer.py and various training and evaluation scripts, but there are no dedicated scripts for running the specific ablation studies mentioned in Table 5 of the paper (replacing Zipformer blocks with Conformer blocks, removing NLA, removing attention weights sharing, or removing bypass connections). While the model implementation does include these components (e.g., bypass connections are implemented in the code), there are no command-line arguments or configuration options in the training scripts that would allow for easily running these specific ablation experiments without modifying the source code."
