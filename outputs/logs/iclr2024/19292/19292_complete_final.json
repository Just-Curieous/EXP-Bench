            "method": "Train the baseline Zipformer-M model on the LibriSpeech dataset using the comprehensive training pipeline as outlined in the paper: precompute 80-dimensional Mel filter-bank features (25ms frames with a 10ms shift), apply dynamic bucketing using the Lhotse toolkit, and augment the data via speed perturbation (factors 0.9, 1.0, and 1.1) and SpecAugment. Use mixed precision training together with activation constraints such as Balancer and Whitener for training stability. Then, create a modified variant by removing the temporal downsampling component from the encoder. Replace this component with a Conv-Embed module that applies a downsampling rate of 4 (following the approach used in Conformer), ensuring that all other hyperparameters, epoch counts, GPU allocation, and training schedules remain constant. After training, evaluate both the baseline and modified models on the LibriSpeech test-clean and test-other sets, and compare the absolute WER values.",

This outcome would validate the importance of the temporal downsampling structure in maintaining efficient modeling capacity without incurring significant information loss.",

Follow these steps:\n\n1. Create a TDNN model architecture:\n   - Implement a PyTorch model with three Conv1d layers\n   - Each Conv1d layer should be followed by ReLU activation and BatchNorm\n   - Add a final linear layer that outputs log probabilities for phoneme classes\n   - The model should take audio features as input and output log probabilities\n\n2. Set up data processing for the yesno dataset:\n   - Create a data module to load and preprocess the yesno dataset\n   - Extract 23-dimensional fbank features from the audio files\n   - Split the data into training and testing sets\n\n3. Implement the training process:\n   - Use CTC loss for training the model\n   - Set up an SGD optimizer with appropriate learning rate (around 1e-2)\n   - Train the model for sufficient epochs (around 15) to achieve convergence\n   - Save checkpoints and track the best model based on validation loss\n\n4. Implement decoding and evaluation:\n   - Create a decoding function that converts model outputs to word sequences\n   - Use k2's one_best_decoding for finding the best path\n   - Evaluate the model on the test set and calculate Word Error Rate (WER)\n   - Report the WER and verify it is less than 1%\n\nThe yesno dataset consists of recordings of someone saying 'yes' or 'no' in various combinations. Your goal is to train a model that can accurately recognize these words with a WER of less than 1%.",

            "experiment_design": "Implement a variant of the Zipformer model where, during training, an auxiliary module monitors activation statistics and dynamically selects the best-suited activation function for each module. Train this adaptive model on the LibriSpeech dataset and compare it with fixed versions (only Swoosh or only Swish). Evaluate using metrics like WER and training stability to determine if dynamic selection can yield further improvements or robustness enhancements.",

        "Temporal downsampling in the encoder not only improves efficiency but also enhances modeling capacity without significant information loss, as demonstrated by lower WERs compared to models without downsampling.",
        "Ablation studies reveal that even small structural modifications (e.g., changes to block structure, normalization layers, or activation functions) lead to measurable differences in performance (WER on test-clean and test-other).",
        "The use of additional constraints like the Balancer and Whitener helps ensure training consistency and stabilizes gradients, thereby avoiding badly trained modules, albeit with marginal improvements in WER.",
        "Different model scales (Zipformer-S, -M, and -L) with varied layer numbers, embedding dimensions, and feed-forward dimensions allow flexible trade-offs between parameter count and performance.",
        "The choice of optimizer (ScaledAdam vs. Adam) and hyperparameter configurations (as seen in tables comparing different base settings) is crucial, sometimes yielding improvements in WER and efficiency when appropriately tuned."
