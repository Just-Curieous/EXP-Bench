  "requirements": [
    "Step 1: Import necessary libraries (torch, numpy, PIL, etc.) for image processing and animation creation (advanced_motion_example.py:1-8)",
    "Step 2: Define a function to save video frames as GIF animations using PIL's save method with duration and loop parameters (advanced_motion_example.py:10-18)",
    "Step 3: Create a SimpleMotionModel base class that defines the interface for applying motion patterns to images (advanced_motion_example.py:20-30)",
    "Step 4: Implement the ZoomMotion class that inherits from SimpleMotionModel and creates a zoom-in/out effect by scaling the image (advanced_motion_example.py:32-50)",
    "Step 5: Implement the PanMotion class that inherits from SimpleMotionModel and creates a panning effect by translating the image (advanced_motion_example.py:52-70)",
    "Step 6: Implement the RotateMotion class that inherits from SimpleMotionModel and creates a rotation effect by rotating the image around its center (advanced_motion_example.py:72-90)",
    "Step 7: Create a function to generate sample static images with different patterns (gradient, checkerboard, circles) (advanced_motion_example.py:92-120)",
    "Step 8: In the main function, create instances of each motion class and apply them to different static images (advanced_motion_example.py:122-140)",
    "Step 9: Save individual animations for each motion type applied to different images (advanced_motion_example.py:142-155)",
    "Step 10: Create and save a combined animation showing all transformations sequentially (advanced_motion_example.py:157-170)"

  "agent_instructions": "Create a Python script that applies different motion transformations to static images to create animations. The script should:\n\n1. Import necessary libraries for image processing (torch, numpy, PIL, etc.)\n\n2. Create a function to save sequences of frames as GIF animations\n\n3. Implement a SimpleMotionModel class hierarchy:\n   - A base class that defines the interface for applying motion patterns\n   - ZoomMotion class that creates zoom-in/out effects by scaling images\n   - PanMotion class that creates panning effects by translating images\n   - RotateMotion class that creates rotation effects by rotating images around their centers\n\n4. Create a function to generate sample static images with different patterns (such as gradient, checkerboard, circles)\n\n5. In the main function:\n   - Generate several sample static images\n   - Create instances of each motion transformation class\n   - Apply each motion transformation to a different static image\n   - Save individual animations for each transformation\n   - Create and save a combined animation showing all transformations\n\nThe output should be multiple GIF animations showing zoom, pan, and rotation effects applied to different static images, plus a combined animation showing all transformations."
