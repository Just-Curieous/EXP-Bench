    "Step 1: Ensure all required model files are available in the appropriate directories. The models should include: motion modules in 'models/Motion_Module/' (mm_sd_v15_v2.ckpt and v3_sd15_mm.ckpt), DreamBooth model in 'models/DreamBooth_LoRA/' (realisticVisionV60B1_v51VAE.safetensors), and MotionLoRA models in 'models/MotionLoRA/' (v2_lora_ZoomIn.ckpt, v2_lora_ZoomOut.ckpt, v2_lora_PanLeft.ckpt, v2_lora_PanRight.ckpt, v2_lora_TiltUp.ckpt, v2_lora_TiltDown.ckpt, v2_lora_RollingAnticlockwise.ckpt, v2_lora_RollingClockwise.ckpt). If any model is missing, the script will attempt to download it automatically. (/workspace/scripts/animate.py:106-176)",
    "Step 2: Run the baseline AnimateDiff without MotionLoRA by executing the animate.py script with the RealisticVision configuration. This will use motion modules but no motion LoRA adaptations. (/workspace/scripts/animate.py:31-197)",
    "Step 3: The baseline animation process loads the specified motion module (v3_sd15_mm.ckpt or mm_sd_v15_v2.ckpt) and DreamBooth model (realisticVisionV60B1_v51VAE.safetensors) to initialize the animation pipeline. (/workspace/configs/prompts/1_animate/1_1_animate_RealisticVision.yaml:1-46)",
    "Step 4: The baseline animation generates videos for multiple prompts (including a man in black clothes, a rabbit, coastline scenes, and an old house) using specified random seeds for reproducibility. (/workspace/configs/prompts/1_animate/1_1_animate_RealisticVision.yaml:8-22)",
    "Step 5: Run AnimateDiff with MotionLoRA by executing the animate.py script with the MotionLoRA RealisticVision configuration. This will use both motion modules and motion LoRA adaptations for specific camera movements. (/workspace/scripts/animate.py:31-197)",
    "Step 6: The MotionLoRA animation process loads the same base models but additionally applies MotionLoRA adaptations (ZoomIn, ZoomOut, PanLeft, PanRight, TiltUp, TiltDown, RollingAnticlockwise, RollingClockwise) to create different camera motion effects. (/workspace/configs/prompts/2_motionlora/2_motionlora_RealisticVision.yaml:1-174)",
    "Step 7: For each MotionLoRA adaptation, the script generates an animation using the same coastline prompt but with the specific camera movement effect applied. (/workspace/configs/prompts/2_motionlora/2_motionlora_RealisticVision.yaml:16-174)",
    "Step 8: Both animation processes use the AnimationPipeline to generate animations, which involves encoding the text prompt, preparing latents, running the denoising loop with the UNet model, and decoding the latents to produce the final video. (/workspace/animatediff/pipelines/pipeline_animation.py:348-465)",
    "Step 9: The generated animations are saved as GIF files in the samples directory with timestamps in the folder name. (/workspace/scripts/animate.py:37-38, 173-179)",
    "Final Step: Compare the generated animations in the samples folder to evaluate the motion smoothness improvement provided by MotionLoRA. The comparison should focus on how the different camera movements (zoom, pan, tilt, roll) enhance the animation quality compared to the baseline. (/workspace/scripts/animate.py:177-181)"
  ],
  "agent_instructions": "Your task is to reproduce an experiment from the AnimateDiff project that compares animation quality with and without MotionLoRA adaptations. You need to run two different configurations and compare their outputs. First, run the baseline AnimateDiff without MotionLoRA using the provided configuration file. Then, run AnimateDiff with MotionLoRA adaptations using a different configuration file. Finally, examine the generated animations in the samples folder to evaluate how MotionLoRA improves motion smoothness with different camera movements like zooming, panning, tilting, and rolling. The experiment will help demonstrate how MotionLoRA enhances animation quality compared to the baseline AnimateDiff.",
