    "usage_instructions": "To analyze how smooth reliability diagrams reflect calibration quality across diverse domains (deep learning with ImageNet, solar flare forecasting, and precipitation prediction), run the paper_experiments.ipynb notebook. The notebook contains three sections that address the experiment question:\n\n1. 'DNN calibration' section (cell 10) - Uses ImageNet validation data for deep networks\n2. 'Solar Flares' section (cell 13) - Uses solar flare forecasting dataset with 731 days and 25.7% event rate\n3. 'Rain in Finland' section (cell 15) - Uses daily rain forecasts with discrete probabilities in 10% increments\n\nEach section uses the plot_compare() function (defined in cell 8) which generates two reliability diagrams side by side: one using the traditional binned approach (via relplot.rel_diagram_binned) and one using the smooth reliability diagram (via relplot.rel_diagram) with automatic kernel bandwidth selection. The function also computes calibration error metrics.\n\nThe notebook demonstrates that the smooth reliability diagram effectively adapts to different prediction distributions across these diverse domains, providing clearer visual interpretability compared to binned methods."
