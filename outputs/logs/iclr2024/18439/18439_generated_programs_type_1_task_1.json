    "usage_instructions": "Execute the demo.ipynb notebook which demonstrates the comparison between smooth and binned reliability diagrams on a synthetic dataset with oscillatory behavior. The notebook creates a synthetic dataset with 10,000 samples where predictions f are uniformly drawn from [0,1], and the true conditional probability function E[y|f] = f + 0.2*sin(2*pi*f) exhibits oscillatory behavior. The notebook then generates both a smooth reliability diagram using relplot.rel_diagram (which uses kernel smoothing with automatic bandwidth selection) and a binned reliability diagram using relplot.rel_diagram_binned. The comparison allows you to visually assess how well each method captures the non-monotonic oscillatory pattern in the data."
