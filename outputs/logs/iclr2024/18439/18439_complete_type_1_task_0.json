      "question": "Does the smooth reliability diagram produced using the relplot package (which employs Nadaraya\u2013Watson kernel smoothing with a Gaussian kernel and automatic bandwidth selection) provide a more accurate and visually interpretable calibration assessment than the traditional binned reliability diagram for deep neural network predictions?",
      "method": "Using the ImageNet validation set (50,000 samples) and a ResNet32 model, first obtain the predicted probability distributions and predicted class (via argmax) from the network. Then, compute the binary indicator for correct predictions and extract confidence scores. For the traditional binned reliability diagram, aggregate these data points into bins selected by cross-validation (optimizing for regression MSE). For the smooth diagram, use the relplot package to apply Nadaraya\u2013Watson kernel smoothing with a Gaussian kernel at a fixed bandwidth \u03c3* (or with relplot\u2019s recommended automatic settings if desired) and generate the corresponding kernel density estimates of the predictions. Finally, produce the visual reliability diagrams and calculate calibration error metrics\u2014such as smoothECE provided by relplot\u2014for both methods. Compare the diagrams quantitatively (via calibration error numbers) and qualitatively (by visually assessing smoothness, boundary adherence, and density estimates) to evaluate which method offers a more consistent and interpretable calibration assessment.",
      "expected_outcome": "It is expected that the smooth reliability diagram will provide a more consistent and visually interpretable representation of calibration, with well-behaved boundary properties and stable density estimates, thereby indicating lower calibration error compared to the traditional binned method.",

      "usage_instructions": "1. Open the paper_experiments.ipynb notebook in a Jupyter environment. \n2. Run the notebook cells in order. The notebook contains a function called `plot_compare` that generates both traditional binned reliability diagrams and smooth reliability diagrams using the relplot package for comparison. \n3. The notebook loads ImageNet validation data for ResNet models (specifically ResNet34 and ResNeXt50) using the `load_plot_save` function, which fetches the data, extracts confidence scores and binary indicators for correct predictions, and then plots both diagram types side by side. \n4. The binned reliability diagram uses cross-validation to select the optimal number of bins (optimizing for regression MSE), while the smooth diagram uses Nadaraya-Watson kernel smoothing with a Gaussian kernel and automatic bandwidth selection. \n5. The notebook calculates calibration error metrics for both methods, including smoothECE for the kernel-based method. \n6. The side-by-side comparison allows for qualitative assessment of smoothness, boundary adherence, and density estimates between the two methods.",
