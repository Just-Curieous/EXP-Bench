            "question": "Does the smooth reliability diagram produced using the relplot package (which employs Nadaraya\u2013Watson kernel smoothing with a Gaussian kernel and automatic bandwidth selection) provide a more accurate and visually interpretable calibration assessment than the traditional binned reliability diagram for deep neural network predictions?",
            "method": "Using the ImageNet validation set (50,000 samples) and a ResNet32 model, first obtain the predicted probability distributions and predicted class (via argmax) from the network. Then, compute the binary indicator for correct predictions and extract confidence scores. For the traditional binned reliability diagram, aggregate these data points into bins selected by cross-validation (optimizing for regression MSE). For the smooth diagram, use the relplot package to apply Nadaraya\u2013Watson kernel smoothing with a Gaussian kernel at a fixed bandwidth \u03c3* (or with relplot\u2019s recommended automatic settings if desired) and generate the corresponding kernel density estimates of the predictions. Finally, produce the visual reliability diagrams and calculate calibration error metrics\u2014such as smoothECE provided by relplot\u2014for both methods. Compare the diagrams quantitatively (via calibration error numbers) and qualitatively (by visually assessing smoothness, boundary adherence, and density estimates) to evaluate which method offers a more consistent and interpretable calibration assessment.",
            "expected_outcome": "It is expected that the smooth reliability diagram will provide a more consistent and visually interpretable representation of calibration, with well-behaved boundary properties and stable density estimates, thereby indicating lower calibration error compared to the traditional binned method.",

            "question": "Does the smooth reliability diagram (implemented via kernel smoothing with an automatic bandwidth selection, as provided by relplot's default settings) effectively capture non-monotonic conditional probability behavior compared to the binned reliability diagram (accessible via relplot.rel_diagram_binned) on synthetic datasets, particularly in terms of representing oscillatory patterns accurately as seen in Figure 2(d)?",
            "method": "Create a synthetic dataset with 1,000 samples where each prediction fi is uniformly drawn from the interval [0, 1]. Define a deliberately non-monotonic true conditional probability function, for example E[yi | fi] = 0.5 + 0.4 * sin(2\u03c0 * fi), to simulate oscillatory behavior. Then, generate two types of reliability diagrams: (i) a binned reliability diagram using relplot.rel_diagram_binned, with the number of bins chosen via cross-validation optimized for regression test MSE, and (ii) a smooth reliability diagram using relplot.rel_diagram (which applies kernel smoothing with a Gaussian kernel using an automatically selected bandwidth), and compute bootstrapped confidence bands around the estimated conditional probabilities. Quantitatively assess each method by calculating metrics such as bias and mean squared error (MSE) between the estimated conditional probabilities and the true function. Use these metrics to support conclusions regarding each diagram's ability to capture non-monotonic (oscillatory) behavior. The approach aligns with the methodologies demonstrated in the relplot package for generating and evaluating reliability diagrams.",
            "expected_outcome": "The smooth reliability diagram is expected to trace the underlying non-monotonic (oscillatory) pattern more precisely while providing reliable confidence bands that reflect uncertainty, whereas the binned reliability diagram may oversmooth or misrepresent the oscillatory pattern due to its rigid bin boundaries. Quantitatively, the smooth diagram should exhibit lower bias and MSE compared to the binned diagram in estimating the true conditional probability function.",

            "question": "Can the smooth reliability diagram reliably reflect calibration quality across diverse domains such as deep learning (using ImageNet validation data), solar flare forecasting (731 days, 25.7% event rate), and precipitation prediction (346 days of daily forecasts with discrete probabilities in 10% increments) when using a principled kernel smoothing method, as implemented in relplot? In your analysis, consider whether the automatic kernel bandwidth selection effectively adapts to the prediction distributions encountered in these domains.",
            "method": "Select three datasets: (i) the ImageNet validation set for deep networks, (ii) the solar flare forecasting dataset with 731 days and a known event occurrence rate of 25.7%, and (iii) the daily rain forecasts dataset from the Finnish Meteorological Institute covering 346 days with discrete forecasts in 10% increments. For each dataset, generate two reliability diagrams using the relplot package: one using the traditional binned approach (via relplot.rel_diagram_binned) and one using the smooth reliability diagram (via relplot.rel_diagram) which employs automatic kernel bandwidth selection. When generating the smooth reliability diagrams, either use the default automatic bandwidth or override it with a domain-appropriate kernel bandwidth \u03c3* if necessary, ensuring that the kernel density estimates of predictions are clearly visualized. For the solar flare and precipitation datasets, verify that the plotting functions correctly handle the unique prediction distributions (e.g., the discrete probability increments in the precipitation dataset). Additionally, if desired, compute calibration error metrics using rp.smECE and assess the consistency between the conditional mean estimates and density estimates. Evaluate the diagrams in terms of their visual clarity, consistency, and adherence to the [0,1] boundaries.",
            "expected_outcome": "It is expected that across the three diverse domains, the smooth reliability diagrams will consistently display improved visual interpretability and robust calibration error assessment, with clear density estimates and proper handling of boundary constraints, while the binned methods may show instability or less interpretable aggregation, particularly in cases with non-uniform or discrete probability outputs.",

Measure how close the adjusted predictions come to perfect calibration. Compare the amount of adjustment required when using the smooth reliability diagram versus adjustments derived from traditional metrics.
