            "method": "Using the ImageNet validation set (50,000 samples) and a ResNet32 model, first obtain the predicted probability distributions and predicted class (via argmax) from the network. Then, compute the binary indicator for correct predictions and extract confidence scores. For the traditional binned reliability diagram, aggregate these data points into bins selected by cross-validation (optimizing for regression MSE). For the smooth diagram, use the relplot package to apply Nadaraya\u2013Watson kernel smoothing with a Gaussian kernel at a fixed bandwidth \u03c3* (or with relplot\u2019s recommended automatic settings if desired) and generate the corresponding kernel density estimates of the predictions. Finally, produce the visual reliability diagrams and calculate calibration error metrics\u2014such as smoothECE provided by relplot\u2014for both methods. Compare the diagrams quantitatively (via calibration error numbers) and qualitatively (by visually assessing smoothness, boundary adherence, and density estimates) to evaluate which method offers a more consistent and interpretable calibration assessment.",
