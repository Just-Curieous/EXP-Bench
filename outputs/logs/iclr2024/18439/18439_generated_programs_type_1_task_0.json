    "usage_instructions": "1. Open the paper_experiments.ipynb notebook in a Jupyter environment. \n2. Run the notebook cells in order. The notebook contains a function called `plot_compare` that generates both traditional binned reliability diagrams and smooth reliability diagrams using the relplot package for comparison. \n3. The notebook loads ImageNet validation data for ResNet models (specifically ResNet34 and ResNeXt50) using the `load_plot_save` function, which fetches the data, extracts confidence scores and binary indicators for correct predictions, and then plots both diagram types side by side. \n4. The binned reliability diagram uses cross-validation to select the optimal number of bins (optimizing for regression MSE), while the smooth diagram uses Nadaraya-Watson kernel smoothing with a Gaussian kernel and automatic bandwidth selection. \n5. The notebook calculates calibration error metrics for both methods, including smoothECE for the kernel-based method. \n6. The side-by-side comparison allows for qualitative assessment of smoothness, boundary adherence, and density estimates between the two methods."
