    "no_answer": "After thoroughly examining the repository, I couldn't find a specific script or set of scripts that directly answer the experiment question about comparing models with and without the channel aggregation module (CA). While the repository contains the MogaNet implementation with the CA module (in models/moganet.py), training scripts (train.py), and visualization tools like Grad-CAM (cam_image.py), there isn't a ready-made experiment setup that compares models with and without CA. To conduct this experiment, one would need to create a modified version of the MogaNet architecture without the CA module, train both models under identical conditions, and then compare their performance using Grad-CAM visualizations and metrics like MAE and SSIM as specified in the experiment question."
