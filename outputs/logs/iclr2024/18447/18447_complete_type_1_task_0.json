      "hypothesis": "Does the MogaNet architecture outperform existing lightweight models in ImageNet-1K classification when trained under standard settings?",
      "method": "Train MogaNet variants (e.g., MogaNet-T and MogaNet-XT) on the ImageNet-1K dataset for 300 epochs. Use the AdamW optimizer with a basic learning rate of 1e-3 and a cosine scheduler, incorporating learning rate decay steps at epochs 170 and 200. The training is performed on NVIDIA A100 GPUs using the PyTorch framework. Standard input resolutions (e.g., 224x224 and 256x256) will be used, and performance will be measured in terms of top-1 accuracy and parameter efficiency. Experiments will compare MogaNet variants against other lightweight architectures (such as ParC-Net-S and T2T-ViT-7) under similar FLOPs and parameter budgets. In addition, details from Table 2 indicate that MogaNet-T is designed to outperform other lightweight architectures by at least 1.0\u20131.1% in top-1 accuracy while efficiently using parameters. Further experimental details follow the standard ImageNet training protocols as described in Touvron et al. (2021a) and Liu et al. (2021).",
      "expected_outcome": "Based on the reported results, MogaNet-T is expected to achieve approximately 79.0% top-1 accuracy at a 224x224 resolution and up to 80.0% top-1 accuracy at a 256x256 resolution. This performance improvement of at least 1.0\u20131.1% compared to current lightweight models, as well as superior parameter efficiency, should be observed in the experimental evaluation.",
