      "hypothesis": "Does refining training configurations, such as using higher input resolutions (256x256 versus 224x224) and optimized scheduling (e.g., switching to a multi-step learning rate scheduler or a cosine scheduler with refined settings), lead to improved convergence speed and a higher final top-1 accuracy in MogaNet-T?",
      "method": "Set up a controlled experiment with MogaNet-T by creating two experimental groups: one using a 224x224 input resolution with the standard training settings (e.g., AdamW optimizer with a base learning rate of 1\u00d710^-3, cosine scheduler over 300 epochs) and another using a 256x256 input resolution with the refined training configurations as described in the paper (including optimized scheduling such as the multi-step learning rate decay at specified epochs). Ensure that all other factors (optimizer type, learning rate, total epochs, data augmentation) are kept constant between both groups. Record and compare the convergence behavior (e.g., training loss curves and convergence speed) as well as the final top-1 accuracy. Reference results such as those in Table 2, where MogaNet-T achieved 79.0% top-1 accuracy at lower resolutions and approximately 80.0% with refined settings.",
      "expected_outcome": "The experiment is expected to demonstrate that using a higher input resolution alongside refined training settings leads to better convergence (faster and lower training loss) and an increase in top-1 accuracy (for example, an improvement from about 79.0% to around 80.0%), confirming the significant impact of input resolution and training configuration optimizations on the performance of MogaNet-T.",
