    "no_answer": "After thoroughly examining the repository, I couldn't find a specific script or configuration that directly compares models with and without the spatial aggregation module as described in the experiment question. The spatial aggregation module (implemented as MultiOrderGatedAggregation class with FD and Moga branches, gating and context branches with multi-order DWConv layers) is a core component of the MogaNet architecture. Creating a variant without this module would require significant code modifications beyond simple parameter changes or flag toggling. While the repository contains various model variants (xtiny, tiny, small, base, large, xlarge), they all use the same core architecture with the spatial aggregation module, just with different sizes and hyperparameters."
