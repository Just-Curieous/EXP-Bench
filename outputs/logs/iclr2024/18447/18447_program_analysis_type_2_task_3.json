    "Step 1: Import necessary libraries including mmpose.apis for pose estimation functionality (/workspace/pose_estimation/demo/top_down_img_demo.py:1-11)",
    "Step 2: Register the MogaNet model by importing the models module (/workspace/pose_estimation/demo/top_down_img_demo.py:13-15)",
    "Step 3: Parse command line arguments for configuration including pose model config, checkpoint, keypoint threshold, and visualization parameters (/workspace/pose_estimation/demo/top_down_img_demo.py:23-58)",
    "Step 4: Load the COCO dataset annotations to get bounding boxes for people in the image (/workspace/pose_estimation/demo/top_down_img_demo.py:62)",
    "Step 5: Initialize the pose estimation model using init_pose_model() with the appropriate config file and checkpoint (/workspace/pose_estimation/demo/top_down_img_demo.py:64-65)",
    "Step 6: Get dataset information for proper keypoint interpretation (/workspace/pose_estimation/demo/top_down_img_demo.py:67-75)",
    "Step 7: Process each image by retrieving its information and annotations (/workspace/pose_estimation/demo/top_down_img_demo.py:86-91)",
    "Step 8: Create person results from the bounding box annotations (/workspace/pose_estimation/demo/top_down_img_demo.py:93-100)",
    "Step 9: Run inference using inference_top_down_pose_model() to detect keypoints within each person bounding box (/workspace/pose_estimation/demo/top_down_img_demo.py:103-112)",
    "Step 10: Set up output file path for visualization results if specified (/workspace/pose_estimation/demo/top_down_img_demo.py:114-118)",
    "Final Step: Visualize the results using vis_pose_result() which draws the skeleton connections between detected keypoints with configurable parameters for keypoint threshold, radius, and line thickness (/workspace/pose_estimation/demo/top_down_img_demo.py:120-130)"

  "agent_instructions": "Create a script that demonstrates how to use MogaNet for human pose estimation to detect body keypoints in images. The script should:\n\n1. Set up a top-down pose estimation pipeline using MogaNet as the backbone model.\n2. Import the necessary libraries from mmpose, particularly the APIs for model initialization, inference, and visualization.\n3. Ensure the MogaNet model is properly registered in the system.\n4. Load a pre-trained pose estimation model using a configuration file and checkpoint.\n5. Process input images by:\n   - Reading COCO-format annotations that contain person bounding boxes\n   - For each person bounding box in an image, perform keypoint detection\n   - Apply the pose estimation model to detect body keypoints (shoulders, elbows, wrists, hips, knees, ankles, etc.)\n6. Visualize the results by:\n   - Drawing keypoints on the image\n   - Connecting the keypoints with lines to form a skeleton\n   - Filtering keypoints based on a confidence threshold\n   - Configuring visualization parameters like keypoint radius and line thickness\n7. Save the annotated images or display them as specified by the user\n\nThe script should accept command-line arguments for:\n- Pose model configuration file path\n- Model checkpoint file path\n- Input image directory\n- Annotation file path\n- Output directory for visualized results\n- Keypoint confidence threshold\n- Visualization parameters\n\nThe goal is to demonstrate how MogaNet can be effectively applied to human pose estimation tasks, showing its capability to accurately detect human body keypoints and visualize the skeletal structure."
