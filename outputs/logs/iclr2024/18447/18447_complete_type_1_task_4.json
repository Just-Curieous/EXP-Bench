      "hypothesis": "MogaNet variants outperform previous backbones in object detection and instance segmentation tasks on COCO.",
      "method": "Using the COCO train2017 and val2017 datasets, fine-tune object detectors (RetinaNet, Mask R-CNN, and Cascade Mask R-CNN) with different backbones including ResNet-101, PVT-S, and the proposed MogaNet variants (e.g., MogaNet-T and MogaNet-XL). Train the models under specified settings: use a 1\u00d7 training schedule for RetinaNet and Mask R-CNN and a 3\u00d7 schedule for Cascade Mask R-CNN. The training employs the AdamW optimizer with an initial learning rate (e.g., 1\u00d710\u22123) and a cosine learning rate scheduler, while images are resized to resolutions such as 256\u00d7192 or 384\u00d7288. Record detailed performance metrics including box mean Average Precision (APb) and mask mean Average Precision (APm) along with model parameters and FLOPs. In particular, compare reported improvements such as Mask R-CNN with MogaNet-T achieving 42.6 APb, outperforming Swin-T by 0.4 APb with 48% and 27% reductions in parameters and FLOPs, and Cascade Mask R-CNN with MogaNet-XL achieving 56.2 APb, surpassing ConvNeXt-L and RepLKNet-31L by +1.4 and +2.3 APb respectively. The experimental setup also includes referencing detailed architecture and stage output information provided in Table 1, Table 2, and Table 3 as well as additional statistical results noted in Tables A8 and A9 and related figures in the document. All experiments are implemented in PyTorch and run on NVIDIA A100 GPUs to ensure consistent evaluation of convergence speed, computational efficiency, and overall performance improvements.",
      "expected_outcome": "MogaNet variants are expected to achieve significantly higher APb and APm scores while using fewer computational resources (in terms of parameters and FLOPs) compared to traditional backbones. This validation of improved efficiency and effectiveness in dense prediction tasks is anticipated to be clearly supported by detailed quantitative comparisons and visualized architecture designs.",

      "usage_instructions": "To validate the hypothesis that MogaNet variants outperform previous backbones in object detection and instance segmentation tasks on COCO, follow these steps:\n\n1. First, train the models using the provided configurations. For example, to train RetinaNet with MogaNet-T backbone for 1x schedule:\n   ```bash\n   cd /workspace/detection\n   PORT=29001 bash dist_train.sh configs/moganet/retinanet_moganet_tiny_fpn_1x_coco.py 8\n   ```\n\n2. Similarly, train Mask R-CNN with MogaNet-T backbone for 1x schedule:\n   ```bash\n   PORT=29002 bash dist_train.sh configs/moganet/mask_rcnn_moganet_tiny_fpn_1x_coco.py 8\n   ```\n\n3. For Cascade Mask R-CNN with MogaNet-XL backbone for 3x schedule:\n   ```bash\n   PORT=29003 bash dist_train.sh configs/moganet/cascade_mask_rcnn_moganet_l_fpn_giou_4conv1f_ms_3x_coco.py 8\n   ```\n\n4. After training, evaluate the models to get the performance metrics (APb and APm):\n   ```bash\n   # For RetinaNet (box AP only)\n   bash dist_test.sh configs/moganet/retinanet_moganet_tiny_fpn_1x_coco.py /path/to/checkpoint 8 --out results.pkl --eval bbox\n   \n   # For Mask R-CNN (both box AP and mask AP)\n   bash dist_test.sh configs/moganet/mask_rcnn_moganet_tiny_fpn_1x_coco.py /path/to/checkpoint 8 --out results.pkl --eval bbox segm\n   \n   # For Cascade Mask R-CNN (both box AP and mask AP)\n   bash dist_test.sh configs/moganet/cascade_mask_rcnn_moganet_l_fpn_giou_4conv1f_ms_3x_coco.py /path/to/checkpoint 8 --out results.pkl --eval bbox segm\n   ```\n\n5. To compare with other backbones like ResNet-101 and PVT-S, you would need to run similar commands with their respective configuration files (not included in this repository but would follow the same pattern).\n\nNote: The repository already includes pre-trained models and their performance metrics in the README.md file, which shows that MogaNet variants achieve higher APb and APm scores with fewer parameters and FLOPs compared to traditional backbones, confirming the hypothesis.",
