    "no_answer": "After thoroughly exploring the repository, I couldn't find scripts that directly answer the experiment question about higher input resolutions combined with IN-21K pre-training improving semantic segmentation performance on ADE20K. The repository contains code for semantic segmentation on ADE20K using MogaNet with both Semantic FPN and UperNet architectures, but the existing configurations use standard 512x512 resolution and ImageNet-1K pre-trained weights. While the repository has the infrastructure for semantic segmentation with MogaNet on ADE20K, it doesn't have ready-made scripts that specifically compare standard resolution (512x512) vs. higher resolution inputs or ImageNet-1K vs. ImageNet-21K pre-training. The TRAINING.md mentions that ImageNet-21K training is available in the OpenMixup implementation, but not directly in this repository. To conduct the experiment described, one would need to modify the existing configurations to create custom experiments with higher resolutions and IN-21K pre-trained weights."
