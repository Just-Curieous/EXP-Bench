            "method": "Train MogaNet variants (e.g., MogaNet-T and MogaNet-XT) on the ImageNet-1K dataset for 300 epochs. Use the AdamW optimizer with a basic learning rate of 1e-3 and a cosine scheduler, incorporating learning rate decay steps at epochs 170 and 200. The training is performed on NVIDIA A100 GPUs using the PyTorch framework. Standard input resolutions (e.g., 224x224 and 256x256) will be used, and performance will be measured in terms of top-1 accuracy and parameter efficiency. Experiments will compare MogaNet variants against other lightweight architectures (such as ParC-Net-S and T2T-ViT-7) under similar FLOPs and parameter budgets. In addition, details from Table 2 indicate that MogaNet-T is designed to outperform other lightweight architectures by at least 1.0\u20131.1% in top-1 accuracy while efficiently using parameters. Further experimental details follow the standard ImageNet training protocols as described in Touvron et al. (2021a) and Liu et al. (2021).",

This performance improvement of at least 1.0\u20131.1% compared to current lightweight models, as well as superior parameter efficiency, should be observed in the experimental evaluation.",

Train the models under specified settings: use a 1\u00d7 training schedule for RetinaNet and Mask R-CNN and a 3\u00d7 schedule for Cascade Mask R-CNN. The training employs the AdamW optimizer with an initial learning rate (e.g., 1\u00d710\u22123) and a cosine learning rate scheduler, while images are resized to resolutions such as 256\u00d7192 or 384\u00d7288. Record detailed performance metrics including box mean Average Precision (APb) and mask mean Average Precision (APm) along with model parameters and FLOPs. In particular, compare reported improvements such as Mask R-CNN with MogaNet-T achieving 42.6 APb, outperforming Swin-T by 0.4 APb with 48% and 27% reductions in parameters and FLOPs, and Cascade Mask R-CNN with MogaNet-XL achieving 56.2 APb, surpassing ConvNeXt-L and RepLKNet-31L by +1.4 and +2.3 APb respectively.

For 3D face and hand surface reconstruction, use the ExPose framework on datasets like Stirling/ESRC 3D, FFHP, and FreiHAND by fine-tuning for 100 epochs with the Adam optimizer, and measure performance using metrics such as 3DRMSE and PA-MPJPE as reported in Table 7. For video prediction, train a SimVP architecture augmented with MogaNet blocks on the MMNIST dataset for 200 epochs from scratch using the Adam optimizer, and evaluate the outcomes using mean squared error (MSE) and Structural Similarity Index (SSIM). All experiments should be implemented in PyTorch and executed on NVIDIA A100 GPUs to ensure a fair and controlled comparison against state-of-the-art Transformer-based and ConvNet architectures.",

In the 3D reconstruction tasks, MogaNet-S is expected to achieve the lowest 3DRMSE and PA-MPJPE, surpassing other Transformer and ConvNet architectures. Additionally, for video prediction, a notable reduction in MSE and an improved SSIM score are expected over traditional models such as ConvNeXt or HorNet, collectively demonstrating MogaNet's robust performance across dense prediction and related tasks.",

        "Extensive ablation studies and experiment results underscore the efficacy of specific design choices (e.g., the use of pre-trained weights, optimizer settings, and learning rate schedules), which contribute to robust model performance.",
        "Comparative studies in the paper demonstrate that MogaNet variants can offer measurable improvements (e.g., +1.1 mIoU over some competitor models) over leading ConvNets and Transformers under similar computational budgets."
