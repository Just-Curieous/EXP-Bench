      "hypothesis": "MogaNet variants deliver improved performance across 2D/3D human pose estimation and video prediction tasks compared to baseline architectures.",
      "method": "For 2D human pose estimation, implement the Top-Down SimpleBaseline framework on the COCO keypoint dataset using the MMPose codebase. The setups should initialize models with ImageNet-1K pre-trained weights and fine-tune for 210 epochs using the Adam optimizer with a multi-step learning rate scheduler that decays at 170 and 200 epochs. Evaluate performance on inputs with resolutions of 256\u00d7192 and 384\u00d7288, and compare MogaNet-S and MogaNet-B against baselines such as Swin-T, PVTV2-B2, Swin-L, and Uniformer-B, noting improvements in average precision (AP) as shown in Table 6 and Table A13. For 3D face and hand surface reconstruction, use the ExPose framework on datasets like Stirling/ESRC 3D, FFHP, and FreiHAND by fine-tuning for 100 epochs with the Adam optimizer, and measure performance using metrics such as 3DRMSE and PA-MPJPE as reported in Table 7. For video prediction, train a SimVP architecture augmented with MogaNet blocks on the MMNIST dataset for 200 epochs from scratch using the Adam optimizer, and evaluate the outcomes using mean squared error (MSE) and Structural Similarity Index (SSIM). All experiments should be implemented in PyTorch and executed on NVIDIA A100 GPUs to ensure a fair and controlled comparison against state-of-the-art Transformer-based and ConvNet architectures.",
      "expected_outcome": "It is anticipated that MogaNet variants will yield at least a 0.9 AP improvement in 2D pose estimation when evaluated at varying input resolutions, with MogaNet-B expected to perform particularly well at 384\u00d7288 compared to baselines. In the 3D reconstruction tasks, MogaNet-S is expected to achieve the lowest 3DRMSE and PA-MPJPE, surpassing other Transformer and ConvNet architectures. Additionally, for video prediction, a notable reduction in MSE and an improved SSIM score are expected over traditional models such as ConvNeXt or HorNet, collectively demonstrating MogaNet's robust performance across dense prediction and related tasks.",

For video prediction on MMNIST: Install SimVPv2 with 'python setup.py develop' in the video_prediction directory. Download MMNIST dataset using the provided script at 'tools/prepare_data/download_mmnist.sh'.
