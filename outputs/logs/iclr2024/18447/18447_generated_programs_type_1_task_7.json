    "no_answer": "After thoroughly examining the repository, I couldn't find specific scripts dedicated to performing the ablation study described in the experiment question. While the repository contains the MogaNet implementation with both the Moga module (MultiOrderGatedAggregation class) and Channel Attention module (ChannelAggregationFFN class) as part of the MogaBlock, there are no scripts that systematically remove these components to evaluate their impact on model performance. The repository includes standard training (train.py) and validation (validate.py) scripts for ImageNet-1K classification, but no specific code for analyzing the interaction strength J(m) or conducting ablation experiments on these particular modules. To perform the requested experiment, one would need to modify the model architecture in models/moganet.py to create ablated variants and then use the standard training pipeline to evaluate them."
