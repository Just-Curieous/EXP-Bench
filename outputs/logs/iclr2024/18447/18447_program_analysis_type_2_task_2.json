  "requirements": [
    "Step 1: Import necessary libraries including mmseg.apis for segmentation functionality (inference_segmentor, init_segmentor, show_result_pyplot) and palette generation (/workspace/segmentation/demo/image_demo.py:4-5)",
    "Step 2: Set up the Python path to include the parent directory for model registration (/workspace/segmentation/demo/image_demo.py:7-11)",
    "Step 3: Define a main function that parses command line arguments for input image, config file, checkpoint file, output file path, device, color palette, and opacity (/workspace/segmentation/demo/image_demo.py:14-31)",
    "Step 4: Initialize the segmentation model using init_segmentor() with the provided config file and checkpoint file (/workspace/segmentation/demo/image_demo.py:34)",
    "Step 5: Run inference on the input image using inference_segmentor() (/workspace/segmentation/demo/image_demo.py:36)",
    "Step 6: Visualize the segmentation results using show_result_pyplot() with the specified color palette and opacity (/workspace/segmentation/demo/image_demo.py:38-44)",
    "Final Step: Execute the main function when the script is run directly (/workspace/segmentation/demo/image_demo.py:47-48)"

  "agent_instructions": "Create a Python script for semantic segmentation using the MogaNet model. The script should demonstrate how to segment an image into different semantic regions and visualize the results.\n\nYour script should:\n\n1. Import the necessary libraries from mmseg.apis for segmentation functionality, including functions for model initialization, inference, and visualization.\n\n2. Register the MogaNet model by importing the appropriate module. MogaNet is a backbone model that needs to be registered with the mmseg framework.\n\n3. Create a command-line interface that accepts the following parameters:\n   - Input image path\n   - Model configuration file path\n   - Model checkpoint file path\n   - Optional output file path to save the visualization\n   - Device to use for inference (default: 'cuda:0')\n   - Color palette for visualization (default: 'ade20k')\n   - Opacity for the segmentation overlay (default: 0.5, should be in range (0, 1])\n\n4. Initialize the segmentation model using the provided configuration and checkpoint files.\n\n5. Perform inference on the input image to generate a segmentation map.\n\n6. Visualize the results by overlaying the segmentation map on the original image, with each semantic class represented by a different color according to the specified palette.\n\n7. Either display the visualization or save it to the specified output file.\n\nThe script should be executable from the command line and handle the entire process from loading the model to visualizing the results."
