    "usage_instructions": "To validate the hypothesis that MogaNet variants outperform previous backbones in object detection and instance segmentation tasks on COCO, follow these steps:\n\n1. First, train the models using the provided configurations. For example, to train RetinaNet with MogaNet-T backbone for 1x schedule:\n   ```bash\n   cd /workspace/detection\n   PORT=29001 bash dist_train.sh configs/moganet/retinanet_moganet_tiny_fpn_1x_coco.py 8\n   ```\n\n2. Similarly, train Mask R-CNN with MogaNet-T backbone for 1x schedule:\n   ```bash\n   PORT=29002 bash dist_train.sh configs/moganet/mask_rcnn_moganet_tiny_fpn_1x_coco.py 8\n   ```\n\n3. For Cascade Mask R-CNN with MogaNet-XL backbone for 3x schedule:\n   ```bash\n   PORT=29003 bash dist_train.sh configs/moganet/cascade_mask_rcnn_moganet_l_fpn_giou_4conv1f_ms_3x_coco.py 8\n   ```\n\n4. After training, evaluate the models to get the performance metrics (APb and APm):\n   ```bash\n   # For RetinaNet (box AP only)\n   bash dist_test.sh configs/moganet/retinanet_moganet_tiny_fpn_1x_coco.py /path/to/checkpoint 8 --out results.pkl --eval bbox\n   \n   # For Mask R-CNN (both box AP and mask AP)\n   bash dist_test.sh configs/moganet/mask_rcnn_moganet_tiny_fpn_1x_coco.py /path/to/checkpoint 8 --out results.pkl --eval bbox segm\n   \n   # For Cascade Mask R-CNN (both box AP and mask AP)\n   bash dist_test.sh configs/moganet/cascade_mask_rcnn_moganet_l_fpn_giou_4conv1f_ms_3x_coco.py /path/to/checkpoint 8 --out results.pkl --eval bbox segm\n   ```\n\n5. To compare with other backbones like ResNet-101 and PVT-S, you would need to run similar commands with their respective configuration files (not included in this repository but would follow the same pattern).\n\nNote: The repository already includes pre-trained models and their performance metrics in the README.md file, which shows that MogaNet variants achieve higher APb and APm scores with fewer parameters and FLOPs compared to traditional backbones, confirming the hypothesis."
