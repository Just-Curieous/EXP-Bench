Experiments will compare MogaNet variants against other lightweight architectures (such as ParC-Net-S and T2T-ViT-7) under similar FLOPs and parameter budgets. In addition, details from Table 2 indicate that MogaNet-T is designed to outperform other lightweight architectures by at least 1.0\u20131.1% in top-1 accuracy while efficiently using parameters. Further experimental details follow the standard ImageNet training protocols as described in Touvron et al. (2021a) and Liu et al. (2021).",
