    "no_answer": "After a thorough examination of the repository, I couldn't find a specific script or set of scripts that directly answers the experiment question about comparing MACs between PDF, PatchTST, and Crossformer models. The repository contains code for PDF and PatchTST models, but Crossformer is not implemented in the codebase. There is a `test_params_flop` function in `utils/tools.py` that can measure MACs for a model, but it's not properly implemented in `exp_main.py` (it's called with incorrect parameters). There's a `--test_flop` flag in `run_longExp.py`, but it's not used in any of the shell scripts. To answer the experiment question, one would need to implement a script that runs all three models with different configurations and measures their MACs, which is not available in the current repository."
