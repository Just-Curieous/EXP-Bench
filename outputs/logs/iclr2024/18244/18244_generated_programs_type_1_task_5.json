    "usage_instructions": "To compare the performance of PDF model with parallel convolution, sequential convolution, and without convolution on the four datasets (ETTh2, Weather, Electricity, and Traffic) with prediction horizons {96, 192, 336, 720}, follow these steps:\n\n1. First, run the default scripts for parallel convolution (Par Conv) using the provided scripts:\n   ```\n   sh /workspace/scripts/PDF/336/etth2.sh\n   sh /workspace/scripts/PDF/336/weather.sh\n   sh /workspace/scripts/PDF/336/electricity.sh\n   sh /workspace/scripts/PDF/336/traffic.sh\n   sh /workspace/scripts/PDF/720/etth2.sh\n   sh /workspace/scripts/PDF/720/weather.sh\n   sh /workspace/scripts/PDF/720/electricity.sh\n   sh /workspace/scripts/PDF/720/traffic.sh\n   ```\n\n2. For sequential convolution (Seq Conv), modify each script by adding the `--serial_conv` flag to the python command. For example:\n   ```\n   python -u run_longExp.py --serial_conv --random_seed 2021 ...\n   ```\n\n3. For without convolution (w/o Conv), modify each script by adding the `--wo_conv` flag to the python command. For example:\n   ```\n   python -u run_longExp.py --wo_conv --random_seed 2021 ...\n   ```\n\n4. After running all experiments, the results will be stored in the following locations:\n   - Trained models: ./checkpoints\n   - Visualization outputs: ./test_results\n   - Numerical results: ./results\n   - Summary of metrics: ./results.txt\n\n5. Compare the MSE and MAE values across the three variants (Par Conv, Seq Conv, w/o Conv) for each dataset and prediction horizon to determine which configuration yields superior forecasting performance."
