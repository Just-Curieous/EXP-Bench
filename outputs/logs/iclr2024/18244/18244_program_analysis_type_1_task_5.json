  "agent_instructions": "Your task is to implement scripts that compare the performance of the PDF (Periodic Decomposition and Fusion) model with different convolution configurations on time series forecasting tasks. The experiment should evaluate three variants of the model: parallel convolution (default), sequential convolution, and without convolution, across four datasets with different prediction horizons.\n\nSpecifically, you need to:\n\n1. Create scripts to run experiments on four datasets: ETTh2, Weather, Electricity, and Traffic.\n\n2. For each dataset, run experiments with two sequence lengths (336 and 720) and four prediction horizons (96, 192, 336, 720).\n\n3. For each configuration, run the PDF model in three modes:\n   - With parallel convolution (default setting)\n   - With sequential convolution (by adding the --serial_conv flag)\n   - Without convolution (by adding the --wo_conv flag)\n\n4. The experiments should use the run_longExp.py script with appropriate parameters for each dataset. Key parameters include:\n   - Model: PDF\n   - Features: M (multivariate)\n   - Training epochs: 100\n   - Random seed: 2021\n   - Dataset-specific parameters (input dimensions, model architecture, etc.)\n\n5. Ensure outputs are properly logged for later analysis.\n\n6. After running all experiments, compare the MSE and MAE values across the three variants for each dataset and prediction horizon to determine which configuration yields superior forecasting performance.\n\nThe results will be stored in the following locations:\n- Trained models: ./checkpoints\n- Visualization outputs: ./test_results\n- Numerical results: ./results\n- Summary of metrics: ./results.txt",
