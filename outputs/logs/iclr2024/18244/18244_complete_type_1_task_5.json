      "hypothesis": "Will incorporating a parallel convolution module in the PDF model yield superior forecasting performance compared to using sequential convolution or omitting the convolution module entirely?",
      "method": "Design an experiment using the four datasets mentioned: ETTh2, Weather, Electricity, and Traffic. For each dataset, set the prediction horizons T to {96, 192, 336, 720} and use the same normalization protocol as in the paper (zero-mean normalization using training set mean and standard deviation). Configure the PDF model in three variants: one with parallel convolution (Par Conv), one with sequential convolution (Seq Conv), and one without any convolution (w/o Conv). For the look-back window, use t = 336 and t = 720 for the PDF model variants, ensuring that all other experimental settings (e.g., hyperparameters and normalization methods) are consistent with those reported in the original paper. Compute forecasting performance using Mean Square Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) metrics. Tabulate the results similarly to Table 4 in the paper, providing side-by-side comparisons for each configuration on each dataset. Additionally, analyze model performance with attention to datasets that exhibit varying levels of periodicity (for example, assess whether datasets like Traffic, which have strong periodicity, show different trends compared to Weather or Electricity). Also, where applicable, refer to related figures (e.g., overview diagrams in Figures 1\u201323) to ensure that the convolution module integration aligns with the overall model architecture described in the paper.",
      "expected_outcome": "Based on the paper's results, incorporating a parallel convolution module (Par Conv) is expected to yield lower MSE and MAE values compared to the sequential convolution (Seq Conv) version and the version without any convolution (w/o Conv), across most datasets and prediction horizons. However, note that datasets with strong periodicity, such as Traffic, might show nuanced performance variations, potentially revealing challenges in balancing the modeling of short-term and long-term variations. The refined results should demonstrate that Par Conv consistently achieves the best or second-best performance, as observed in the ablation studies.",

First, run the default scripts for parallel convolution (Par Conv) using the provided scripts:\n   ```\n   sh /workspace/scripts/PDF/336/etth2.sh\n   sh /workspace/scripts/PDF/336/weather.sh\n   sh /workspace/scripts/PDF/336/electricity.sh\n   sh /workspace/scripts/PDF/336/traffic.sh\n   sh /workspace/scripts/PDF/720/etth2.sh\n   sh /workspace/scripts/PDF/720/weather.sh\n   sh /workspace/scripts/PDF/720/electricity.sh\n   sh /workspace/scripts/PDF/720/traffic.sh\n   ```\n\n2. For sequential convolution (Seq Conv), modify each script by adding the `--serial_conv` flag to the python command. For example:\n   ```\n   python -u run_longExp.py --serial_conv --random_seed 2021 ...\n   ```\n\n3. For without convolution (w/o Conv), modify each script by adding the `--wo_conv` flag to the python command. For example:\n   ```\n   python -u run_longExp.py --wo_conv --random_seed 2021 ...\n   ```\n\n4.
