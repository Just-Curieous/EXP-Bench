  "agent_instructions": "Your task is to compare the performance of PDF and PatchTST models on the electricity dataset for long-term time series forecasting. Follow these steps:\n\n1. Set up the environment with the electricity dataset in the ./dataset/ directory.\n\n2. Create a script to train and evaluate the PDF model with the following configuration:\n   - Model: PDF\n   - Dataset: electricity.csv\n   - Features: Multivariate (M)\n   - Sequence length (seq_len): 336\n   - Prediction length (pred_len): 720\n   - Input dimension (enc_in): 321\n   - Model architecture parameters:\n     - e_layers: 3\n     - n_heads: 32\n     - d_model: 128\n     - d_ff: 256\n     - dropout: 0.45\n     - fc_dropout: 0.15\n   - PDF-specific parameters:\n     - kernel_list: 3 3 5\n     - period: 8 12 24 168 336\n     - patch_len: 1 2 3 16 24\n     - stride: 1 2 3 16 24\n\n3. Create a script to train and evaluate the PatchTST model with the following configuration:\n   - Model: PatchTST\n   - Dataset: electricity.csv\n   - Features: Multivariate (M)\n   - Sequence length (seq_len): 336\n   - Prediction length (pred_len): 720\n   - Input dimension (enc_in): 321\n   - Model architecture parameters:\n     - e_layers: 3\n     - n_heads: 16\n     - d_model: 128\n     - d_ff: 256\n     - dropout: 0.3\n   - PatchTST-specific parameters:\n     - period: 24 12 8\n     - period_enhance: enabled\n     - ratio: 3\n     - d_dim: 64 64 64\n     - patch_len: 1 1 1\n     - stride: 1 1 1\n\n4. For both models:\n   - Train for 100 epochs\n   - Use early stopping with patience (10 for PDF, 20 for PatchTST)\n   - Use learning rate 0.0001 with TST learning rate adjustment\n   - Use batch size of 32\n\n5. After training, evaluate both models on the test set and collect performance metrics (MSE, MAE).\n\n6. Compare the performance metrics between PDF and PatchTST models to determine which performs better for long-term forecasting on the electricity dataset.\n\n7. Generate visualizations comparing predicted vs. actual values for both models if possible.\n\nThe expected outcome is to verify the paper's claim that PDF outperforms PatchTST on the electricity dataset for long-term forecasting (pred_len=720), with lower MSE and MAE values."
