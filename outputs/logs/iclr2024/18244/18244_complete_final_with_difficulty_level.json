Quantitatively assess the percentage improvement of PDF(720) over the transformer-based models, noting the reported overall improvements of 14.59% in MSE and 10.77% in MAE. Additionally, if raw predictions are available, perform statistical tests to confirm the significance of the improvements. Consider cross-referencing with additional semantic details from Table 2 to further validate the robustness of the results.",

Next, run the FEDformer model by executing 'cd /workspace/Formers/FEDformer && sh scripts/LongForecasting.sh', which will train and evaluate the FEDformer model with a 96 look-back window on the same datasets and prediction lengths. After running both sets of scripts, the evaluation metrics (MSE and MAE) will be saved in the './results/' directory and summarized in 'result.txt'.

In the provided method and detailed requirements, components such as configuring the PDF model with specific periodicity-related parameters, setting model architecture parameters, and configuring training parameters are core, as they contribute to implementing the novel PDF method. Non-core components include tasks like creating log directories, running training and evaluation processes, and logging results, which are orchestration steps and do not involve implementing the novel method.

Specifically, assess the mean squared error (MSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) values for each prediction horizon. In the analysis, calculate the overall percentage reduction in errors; the claim is that PDF(720) achieves approximately a 24.61% reduction in MSE and a 19.91% reduction in MAE compared to CNN-based models. In addition, include details on the look-back window settings, noting that while PDF experiments use t = 720, the CNN models use t = 96, which might contribute to differences in capturing temporal dynamics. Extend the investigation by cross-referencing additional aspects from Table 1 such as the Count row that indicates how often each method achieves the best or second-best results, and incorporate any available insights from Table 2 regarding variations with different look-back windows.
