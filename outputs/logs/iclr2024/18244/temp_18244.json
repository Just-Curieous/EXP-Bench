For each dataset and prediction length T in {96, 192, 336, 720}, compare the MSE and MAE values. Quantitatively assess the percentage improvement of PDF(720) over transformer-based models, which is reported as an overall 14.59% reduction in MSE and 10.77% reduction in MAE. Perform statistical tests if raw predictions are available to confirm the significance of the improvements.",
