    "usage_instructions": "To run the ablation study comparing concatenation vs. mean aggregation methods in DVMB outputs, use the following steps:\n\n1. For the Concat aggregation method (default in the paper):\n   - Run the scripts as they are, for example: `sh ./scripts/PDF/336/etth2.sh`\n   - This will run the model with the default concatenation aggregation method\n\n2. For the Mean aggregation method:\n   - Modify the scripts to add the `--add` flag, for example:\n   - Edit the python command in each script to include `--add` before the `--des` parameter\n   - Example: `python -u run_longExp.py ... --add --des Exp ...`\n   - Then run the modified scripts\n\n3. Run both versions for all datasets (ETTh2, ETTm2, Weather, Electricity) and prediction horizons (96, 192, 336, 720) as specified in the scripts\n\n4. Compare the MSE and MAE metrics from the results to determine which aggregation method performs better\n\nThe results will be stored in:\n- Model checkpoints: `./checkpoints/`\n- Visualization outputs: `./test_results/`\n- Numerical results: `./results/`\n- Summary metrics: `./results.txt`"
