      "hypothesis": "PDF(720) outperforms Transformer-based models on long-term forecasting tasks in terms of both MSE and MAE. Specifically, it achieves an overall 14.59% reduction in MSE and 10.77% reduction in MAE compared to transformer-based models, such as FEDformer with a 96 look-back window.",
      "method": "Collect the forecasting performance metrics (MSE and MAE) from evaluation Table 1 for both PDF(720) and transformer-based models (e.g., FEDformer with a 96 look-back window). For each dataset and prediction length T \u2208 {96, 192, 336, 720}, extract and compare the MSE and MAE values. Quantitatively assess the percentage improvement of PDF(720) over the transformer-based models, noting the reported overall improvements of 14.59% in MSE and 10.77% in MAE. Additionally, if raw predictions are available, perform statistical tests to confirm the significance of the improvements. Consider cross-referencing with additional semantic details from Table 2 to further validate the robustness of the results.",
      "expected_outcome": "The experimental results should confirm that PDF(720) consistently achieves lower MSE and MAE across various datasets and prediction lengths than the transformer-based methods, thereby validating the hypothesis. The findings should align with the overall reported improvements and any statistical tests conducted should indicate that these improvements are significant.",

      "usage_instructions": "First, download the datasets as described in the README.md and place them in the './dataset' directory. Then, run the PDF(720) model scripts for each dataset by executing the shell scripts in '/workspace/scripts/PDF/720/' (e.g., 'sh /workspace/scripts/PDF/720/etth1.sh'). These scripts will train and evaluate the PDF model with a 720 look-back window on all datasets for prediction lengths of 96, 192, 336, and 720. Next, run the FEDformer model by executing 'cd /workspace/Formers/FEDformer && sh scripts/LongForecasting.sh', which will train and evaluate the FEDformer model with a 96 look-back window on the same datasets and prediction lengths. After running both sets of scripts, the evaluation metrics (MSE and MAE) will be saved in the './results/' directory and summarized in 'result.txt'. You can then compare these metrics to verify the hypothesis that PDF(720) achieves an overall 14.59% reduction in MSE and 10.77% reduction in MAE compared to transformer-based models like FEDformer.",
