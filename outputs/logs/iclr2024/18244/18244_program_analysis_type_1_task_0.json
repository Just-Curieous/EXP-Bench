  "agent_instructions": "Your task is to implement scripts for comparing two time series forecasting models: PDF (Periodicity Decoupling Framework) with a 720 look-back window and FEDformer with a 96 look-back window. The experiment should be conducted on multiple datasets (ETTh1, ETTh2, ETTm1, ETTm2, electricity, traffic, weather) with different prediction lengths (96, 192, 336, 720).\n\nFirst, create scripts for the PDF model that:\n1. Create necessary log directories for storing results\n2. Configure the PDF model with a sequence length of 720\n3. For each dataset and prediction length combination:\n   - Set appropriate model architecture parameters (encoder layers, attention heads, dimensions)\n   - Configure dataset-specific regularization parameters (dropout rates)\n   - Set periodicity-related parameters (kernel sizes, periods, patch lengths, strides)\n   - Configure training parameters (epochs, patience, learning rate)\n   - Run the training and evaluation process\n   - Save results to log files\n\nThen, create a script for the FEDformer model that:\n1. Creates necessary log directories\n2. For each dataset and prediction length combination:\n   - Configure the FEDformer model with a sequence length of 96\n   - Set appropriate model parameters for each dataset\n   - Run the training and evaluation process\n   - Save results to log files\n\nThe goal is to compare the performance of PDF(720) against FEDformer(96) across all datasets and prediction lengths, measuring the reduction in MSE and MAE metrics.",
