Include a detailed breakdown of how the MACs increase with prediction horizon for each method, noting the difference in growth magnitudes (millions for PDF vs. gillions for PatchTST and Crossformer).

The detailed analysis should reveal that while increasing prediction horizons leads to only a moderate increase in MACs for PDF (in the order of millions), the same increase in PatchTST and Crossformer results in MAC increases in the order of gillions, validating the efficiency of the period patching approach.",

The repository contains code for PDF and PatchTST models, but Crossformer is not implemented in the codebase. There is a `test_params_flop` function in `utils/tools.py` that can measure MACs for a model, but it's not properly implemented in `exp_main.py` (it's called with incorrect parameters). There's a `--test_flop` flag in `run_longExp.py`, but it's not used in any of the shell scripts.

For each dataset, set the prediction horizons T to {96, 192, 336, 720} and use the same normalization protocol as in the paper (zero-mean normalization using training set mean and standard deviation). Configure the PDF model in three variants: one with parallel convolution (Par Conv), one with sequential convolution (Seq Conv), and one without any convolution (w/o Conv). For the look-back window, use t = 336 and t = 720 for the PDF model variants, ensuring that all other experimental settings (e.g., hyperparameters and normalization methods) are consistent with those reported in the original paper. Compute forecasting performance using Mean Square Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) metrics. Tabulate the results similarly to Table 4 in the paper, providing side-by-side comparisons for each configuration on each dataset. Additionally, analyze model performance with attention to datasets that exhibit varying levels of periodicity (for example, assess whether datasets like Traffic, which have strong periodicity, show different trends compared to Weather or Electricity). Also, where applicable, refer to related figures (e.g., overview diagrams in Figures 1\u201323) to ensure that the convolution module integration aligns with the overall model architecture described in the paper.",

      "hypothesis": "Does using the concatenation aggregation method to combine DVMB outputs achieve better forecasting accuracy (i.e., lower MSE and MAE) compared to using the mean aggregation method? Given prior experimental evidence (see values in Table 5) where the Concat method generally yields lower errors than Mean, can this advantage be consistently observed across multiple datasets and prediction horizons?",
      "method": "Develop an ablation study using the datasets provided (ETTh2, ETTm2, Weather, Electricity). Implement two variants of the DVMB aggregation block within the PDF model: (1) Concat: Concatenate the outputs of all DVMBs and project them linearly, following the equation XO = Linear(Concat(\u02c6Xi)), and (2) Mean: Compute the average of the DVMB outputs. Ensure both methods are evaluated under identical configurations, including normalization of data (using the same train/val/test splits as in previous studies: 0.6:0.2:0.2 for ETT datasets and 0.7:0.1:0.2 for the others), the same look-back window sizes (with configurations such as t = 336 and t = 720 as applicable), and prediction horizons T = {96, 192, 336, 720}. Additionally, refer to Table 2 for detailed look-back window settings and ensure comprehensive logging, statistical significance testing where applicable, and consistency with the protocols described in previous literature. Compare the performance of these two variants by evaluating them with both MSE and MAE metrics, and cross-reference the outcomes with the baseline results reported in Table 5.",
      "expected_outcome": "It is anticipated that the Concat aggregation method will deliver marginally better performance than the Mean method, as evidenced by lower MSE and MAE values across most datasets and prediction horizons. This outcome would support the claim that the concatenation of DVMB outputs better preserves the variations necessary for enhanced forecasting accuracy. The experimental results should echo the trends observed in Table 5, thereby reinforcing the methodological choice of aggregation in the PDF model.",
