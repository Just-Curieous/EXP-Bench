      "hypothesis": "A longer look-back window (t = 720) yields better forecasting performance in the PDF framework compared to a shorter look-back window (t = 336). Specifically, it is hypothesized that PDF(720) will exhibit lower MSE and MAE values across prediction horizons T \u2208 {96, 192, 336, 720} owing to its enhanced capacity to capture both short-term and long-term variations, as evidenced by overall reductions (e.g., 14.59% reduction in MSE and 10.77% reduction in MAE when compared to Transformer-based models) reported in the paper.",
      "method": "Utilize the experimental setup where two configurations of the PDF model, PDF(720) and PDF(336), are evaluated on identical datasets with prediction horizons T \u2208 {96, 192, 336, 720}. The data should be normalized to zero-mean and unit variance using statistics from the training set, following the protocols from Zhou et al. (2021). For each experimental run, record the MSE and MAE metrics. Compare the performance differences between the two look-back windows by analyzing results presented in Table 1 (which shows overall forecasting performance across different models and prediction lengths) and Table 2 (which details the impact of patch sizes and semantic information on performance). Additionally, perform statistical tests when possible to assess whether the improvements seen with a longer look-back window are both statistically and practically significant.",
      "expected_outcome": "The experiments are expected to demonstrate that PDF(720) consistently achieves lower MSE and MAE values compared to PDF(336) across all prediction horizons T. This outcome would confirm that incorporating a longer historical context enhances the model\u2019s forecasting capability, as observed in the overall reductions in error metrics. The detailed breakdown in Table 1 and supportive evidence from Table 2 should reflect that PDF(720) outperforms other models, thereby validating the hypothesis.",

      "usage_instructions": "To compare the performance of PDF models with different look-back windows (t = 336 vs t = 720), execute the following steps:\n\n1. First, run the PDF(336) model on the ETTh2 dataset with various prediction horizons:\n   ```\n   sh /workspace/scripts/PDF/336/etth2.sh\n   ```\n   This script will train and evaluate the PDF model with a look-back window of 336 on prediction horizons T \u2208 {96, 192, 336, 720}.\n\n2. Then, run the PDF(720) model on the same dataset with the same prediction horizons:\n   ```\n   sh /workspace/scripts/PDF/720/etth2.sh\n   ```\n   This script will train and evaluate the PDF model with a look-back window of 720 on prediction horizons T \u2208 {96, 192, 336, 720}.\n\n3. After execution, the results will be available in the following locations:\n   - Trained models: ./checkpoints/\n   - Visualization outputs: ./test_results/\n   - Numerical results: ./results/\n   - Summary metrics: ./result.txt\n\n4.
