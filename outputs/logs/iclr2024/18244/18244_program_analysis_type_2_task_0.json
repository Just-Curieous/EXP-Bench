  "agent_instructions": "Your task is to implement an experiment to evaluate the Periodicity Decoupling Framework (PDF) model on the ETTh2 dataset with different prediction lengths. The experiment should analyze how the model's performance changes as the prediction horizon increases.\n\nSpecifically, you need to:\n\n1. Create a script that trains and evaluates the PDF model on the ETTh2 dataset with the following configurations:\n   - Fixed input sequence length of 720\n   - Varying prediction lengths: 96, 192, 336, and 720\n   - The ETTh2 dataset should be loaded from the ./dataset/ directory\n\n2. Implement the PDF model with the following key components:\n   - Reversible Instance Normalization (RevIN) for data normalization\n   - Period decomposition with periods [24, 180, 720]\n   - Convolutional layers with kernel sizes [3, 7, 11]\n   - Patch lengths [4, 16, 48] and corresponding strides\n   - Multi-head attention mechanism with 4 heads\n   - Model dimension of 16 and feed-forward dimension of 128\n   - Appropriate dropout rates (0.6 for general dropout, 0.4 for fully connected layers)\n\n3. Train the model with the following settings:\n   - Maximum of 100 epochs\n   - Early stopping with patience of 10 epochs\n   - Batch size of 128\n   - Learning rate of 0.0001\n\n4. Evaluate the model using multiple metrics:\n   - Mean Squared Error (MSE)\n   - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)\n   - Root Squared Error (RSE)\n\n5. Generate visualizations comparing predicted vs. actual values for each prediction length\n\n6. Analyze and report how the model's performance changes with different prediction lengths\n\nThe expected outcome is a comprehensive evaluation showing how the PDF model performs on the ETTh2 dataset across different prediction horizons, with performance metrics and visualizations for each configuration."
