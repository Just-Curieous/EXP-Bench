Specifically, it achieves an overall 14.59% reduction in MSE and 10.77% reduction in MAE compared to transformer-based models, such as FEDformer with a 96 look-back window.",
            "method": "Collect the forecasting performance metrics (MSE and MAE) from evaluation Table 1 for both PDF(720) and transformer-based models (e.g., FEDformer with a 96 look-back window). For each dataset and prediction length T \u2208 {96, 192, 336, 720}, extract and compare the MSE and MAE values. Quantitatively assess the percentage improvement of PDF(720) over the transformer-based models, noting the reported overall improvements of 14.59% in MSE and 10.77% in MAE. Additionally, if raw predictions are available, perform statistical tests to confirm the significance of the improvements. Consider cross-referencing with additional semantic details from Table 2 to further validate the robustness of the results.",

Specifically, assess the mean squared error (MSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) values for each prediction horizon. In the analysis, calculate the overall percentage reduction in errors; the claim is that PDF(720) achieves approximately a 24.61% reduction in MSE and a 19.91% reduction in MAE compared to CNN-based models. In addition, include details on the look-back window settings, noting that while PDF experiments use t = 720, the CNN models use t = 96, which might contribute to differences in capturing temporal dynamics. Extend the investigation by cross-referencing additional aspects from Table 1 such as the Count row that indicates how often each method achieves the best or second-best results, and incorporate any available insights from Table 2 regarding variations with different look-back windows. If data from multiple datasets are available (such as from Electricity, Traffic, ETTh1, etc.), further validate the consistency of the performance differences.",

Specifically, it is hypothesized that PDF(720) will exhibit lower MSE and MAE values across prediction horizons T \u2208 {96, 192, 336, 720} owing to its enhanced capacity to capture both short-term and long-term variations, as evidenced by overall reductions (e.g., 14.59% reduction in MSE and 10.77% reduction in MAE when compared to Transformer-based models) reported in the paper.",

The data should be normalized to zero-mean and unit variance using statistics from the training set, following the protocols from Zhou et al. (2021). For each experimental run, record the MSE and MAE metrics. Compare the performance differences between the two look-back windows by analyzing results presented in Table 1 (which shows overall forecasting performance across different models and prediction lengths) and Table 2 (which details the impact of patch sizes and semantic information on performance). Additionally, perform statistical tests when possible to assess whether the improvements seen with a longer look-back window are both statistically and practically significant.",

Implement and compare the following experimental configurations: (a) PatchTST(336) with patch length p = 16 and stride s = 8, resulting in 42 patches; (b) PatchTST(336)* with a longer patch length of p = 64 and stride s = 14, yielding 24 patches containing richer semantic content; and (c) PDF(336) employing a single-period patching strategy with period length p1 = 24 and setting both p and s to 1, which gives f1 = 336/24 = 14 and results in 24 patches that capture rich long-term information. Evaluate each configuration using Mean Square Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). Incorporate detailed comparisons by referencing experimental results from Table 2 (which summarizes the look-back configurations across 16 columns and 8 rows) and multivariate forecasting results from Table 1. Further, analyze experimental figures where applicable to visually assess performance trends, ensuring that any improvements in long-term information capture versus enhanced semantic details are clearly quantified.",

This would indicate that effectively capturing long-term dependencies within patches (via the period patching approach) is more beneficial for forecasting accuracy than merely increasing patch length for enhanced semantic content. The refined results, as presented in Table 2 and supported by the broader evaluation in Table 1, should further validate that simply extending semantic content (as with PatchTST(336)*) does not necessarily lead to improved predictive performance.",

Specifically, can PDF achieve around 34.64% lower MACs compared to PatchTST and 74.38% lower MACs compared to Crossformer on average, with even greater improvements in extreme scenarios (e.g., ETTh1 with t = 960 and T = 720)?",

Include a detailed breakdown of how the MACs increase with prediction horizon for each method, noting the difference in growth magnitudes (millions for PDF vs. gillions for PatchTST and Crossformer). Additionally, cross-reference the results from Table 2 to understand the impact of patch length (and thus semantic information) on the overall system performance, even though the primary focus is on computational complexity.",

In extreme configurations (e.g., ETTh1 with t = 960 and T = 720), PDF should show dramatically higher efficiency, confirming its lightweight performance advantages. The detailed analysis should reveal that while increasing prediction horizons leads to only a moderate increase in MACs for PDF (in the order of millions), the same increase in PatchTST and Crossformer results in MAC increases in the order of gillions, validating the efficiency of the period patching approach.",

For the look-back window, use t = 336 and t = 720 for the PDF model variants, ensuring that all other experimental settings (e.g., hyperparameters and normalization methods) are consistent with those reported in the original paper. Compute forecasting performance using Mean Square Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) metrics. Tabulate the results similarly to Table 4 in the paper, providing side-by-side comparisons for each configuration on each dataset. Additionally, analyze model performance with attention to datasets that exhibit varying levels of periodicity (for example, assess whether datasets like Traffic, which have strong periodicity, show different trends compared to Weather or Electricity). Also, where applicable, refer to related figures (e.g., overview diagrams in Figures 1\u201323) to ensure that the convolution module integration aligns with the overall model architecture described in the paper.",

Ensure both methods are evaluated under identical configurations, including normalization of data (using the same train/val/test splits as in previous studies: 0.6:0.2:0.2 for ETT datasets and 0.7:0.1:0.2 for the others), the same look-back window sizes (with configurations such as t = 336 and t = 720 as applicable), and prediction horizons T = {96, 192, 336, 720}.

This outcome would support the claim that the concatenation of DVMB outputs better preserves the variations necessary for enhanced forecasting accuracy.
