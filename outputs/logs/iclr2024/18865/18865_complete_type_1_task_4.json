      "hypothesis": "Does using circular padding for SineNet on datasets with periodic boundary conditions (e.g., SWE) effectively reduce one-step and rollout prediction errors compared to using zero padding?",
      "method": "Implement SineNet-8 on the SWE dataset in two settings: one using circular padding (to properly encode periodic boundary conditions) and one using zero padding, while keeping all other configurations identical (e.g., learning rate, training epochs, network architecture). Record both one-step and rollout error percentages exactly as described in Table 3. In addition, if available, visualize the error progression over time and compare these metrics to further assess the impact of the padding method on the modeling of advection across boundaries.",
      "expected_outcome": "It is expected that the variant employing circular padding will achieve significantly lower one-step and rollout error percentages compared to zero padding, confirming that incorporating periodic boundary information is essential for accurate simulation of advection phenomena.",

      "usage_instructions": "To compare SineNet-8 with circular padding vs. zero padding on the SWE dataset:\n\n1. First, train the SineNet-8 model with zero padding:\n   ```\n   cd /workspace/OpenPDE/SineNet/pdearena\n   source setup.sh\n   python scripts/train.py -c configs/shallowwater2d_2day.yaml \\\n       --data.data_dir=<path_to_SWE_data> \\\n       --data.num_workers=8 \\\n       --data.batch_size=32 \\\n       --model.name=sinenet8-dual \\\n       --model.lr=2e-4 --optimizer.lr=2e-4\n   ```\n\n2. Then, train the SineNet-8 model with circular padding:\n   ```\n   python scripts/train.py -c configs/shallowwater2d_2day.yaml \\\n       --data.data_dir=<path_to_SWE_data> \\\n       --data.num_workers=8 \\\n       --data.batch_size=32 \\\n       --model.name=sinenet8-dual-circ \\\n       --model.lr=2e-4 --optimizer.lr=2e-4\n   ```\n\n3. The training script automatically runs testing after training completes. The test results will include both one-step and rollout error percentages as described in Table 3 of the paper. The metrics will be logged to TensorBoard and can be found in the output directory.\n\n4. To manually test the models and compare their performance:\n   ```\n   python scripts/test.py test -c configs/shallowwater2d_2day.yaml \\\n       --data.data_dir=<path_to_SWE_data> \\\n       --trainer.devices=1 \\\n       --data.num_workers=8 \\\n       --data.batch_size=32 \\\n       --model.name=sinenet8-dual \\\n       --ckpt_path=<path_to_zero_padding_checkpoint>\n   ```\n\n   And for the circular padding model:\n   ```\n   python scripts/test.py test -c configs/shallowwater2d_2day.yaml \\\n       --data.data_dir=<path_to_SWE_data> \\\n       --trainer.devices=1 \\\n       --data.num_workers=8 \\\n       --data.batch_size=32 \\\n       --model.name=sinenet8-dual-circ \\\n       --ckpt_path=<path_to_circular_padding_checkpoint>\n   ```\n\n5. The test results will include metrics for both one-step prediction errors and rollout errors, which can be compared between the two models to assess the impact of padding method on the modeling of advection across boundaries.",
