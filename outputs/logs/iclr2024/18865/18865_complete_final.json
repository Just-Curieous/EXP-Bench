For each model, conduct both one-step prediction experiments and autoregressive multi-step rollouts extending up to at least T=120 time steps. In the case of CNS, record error metrics for key physical fields such as density, pressure, and velocity components (referencing Figures 11 through 14 for detailed comparisons, and Figure 23 for velocity x). Collect the absolute error values as reported in Table 1 and further detailed in additional tables if available. In addition to quantitative evaluation, apply statistical significance testing (e.g., paired t-tests with a threshold of p < 0.05) to determine if the improvements of SineNet-8 over the baselines are statistically robust. Optionally, complement the numerical errors with visualizations replicating the trends observed in the referenced figures to support the quantitative results.",

These improvements should be statistically significant compared to baseline models (F\u2010FNO, DIL-RESNET, U-NET-128, U-NET-MOD), confirming the superior performance of SineNet-8 in capturing the dynamics of fluid systems.",

First, set up the environment:\n   ```\n   cd /workspace/OpenPDE/SineNet/pdearena\n   source setup.sh\n   ```\n\n2. Create a SineNet-16 model configuration by adding the following to the MODEL_REGISTRY in `/workspace/OpenPDE/SineNet/pdearena/pdearena/models/registry.py`:\n   ```python\n   \"sinenet16-dual\": { \n       \"class_path\": \"pdearena.modules.sinenet_dual.sinenet\",\n       \"init_args\": {\n           \"hidden_channels\": 64,\n           \"num_waves\": 16,\n           \"mult\": 1.425,\n           \"padding_mode\": \"zeros\",\n           \"par1\": 0\n       },\n   },\n   ```\n\n3. Train SineNet-8 on each dataset:\n   ```\n   # For INS (Incompressible Navier-Stokes)\n   python scripts/train.py -c configs/navierstokes2d.yaml --data.data_dir=<path_to_INS_data> --data.num_workers=8 --data.batch_size=32 --model.name=sinenet8-dual --model.lr=2e-4 --optimizer.lr=2e-4\n   \n   # For CNS (Compressible Navier-Stokes)\n   python scripts/train.py -c configs/cfd.yaml --data.data_dir=<path_to_CNS_data> --data.num_workers=8 --data.batch_size=32 --model.name=sinenet8-dual --model.lr=2e-4 --optimizer.lr=2e-4\n   \n   # For SWE (Shallow Water Equations)\n   python scripts/train.py -c configs/shallowwater2d_2day.yaml --data.data_dir=<path_to_SWE_data> --data.num_workers=8 --data.batch_size=32 --model.name=sinenet8-dual --model.lr=2e-4 --optimizer.lr=2e-4\n   ```\n\n4. Train SineNet-16 on each dataset (using the same hyperparameters):\n   ```\n   # For INS (Incompressible Navier-Stokes)\n   python scripts/train.py -c configs/navierstokes2d.yaml --data.data_dir=<path_to_INS_data> --data.num_workers=8 --data.batch_size=32 --model.name=sinenet16-dual --model.lr=2e-4 --optimizer.lr=2e-4\n   \n   # For CNS (Compressible Navier-Stokes)\n   python scripts/train.py -c configs/cfd.yaml --data.data_dir=<path_to_CNS_data> --data.num_workers=8 --data.batch_size=32 --model.name=sinenet16-dual --model.lr=2e-4 --optimizer.lr=2e-4\n   \n   # For SWE (Shallow Water Equations)\n   python scripts/train.py -c configs/shallowwater2d_2day.yaml --data.data_dir=<path_to_SWE_data> --data.num_workers=8 --data.batch_size=32 --model.name=sinenet16-dual --model.lr=2e-4 --optimizer.lr=2e-4\n   ```\n\n5. Test both models on each dataset to compare one-step and rollout errors:\n   ```\n   # For SineNet-8 on INS\n   python scripts/test.py test -c configs/navierstokes2d.yaml --data.data_dir=<path_to_INS_data> --trainer.devices=1 --data.num_workers=8 --data.batch_size=32 --model.name=sinenet8-dual --ckpt_path=<path_to_sinenet8_INS_checkpoint>\n   \n   # For SineNet-16 on INS\n   python scripts/test.py test -c configs/navierstokes2d.yaml --data.data_dir=<path_to_INS_data> --trainer.devices=1 --data.num_workers=8 --data.batch_size=32 --model.name=sinenet16-dual --ckpt_path=<path_to_sinenet16_INS_checkpoint>\n   ```\n   (Repeat similar commands for CNS and SWE datasets)\n\nThe training script will automatically run testing after training is complete, and the results will include one-step and rollout errors that can be compared between SineNet-8 and SineNet-16 across all three datasets.",
