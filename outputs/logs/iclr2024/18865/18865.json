            "hypothesis": "SineNet-8 yields significantly lower one\u2010step and rollout errors compared to other baseline models (F\u2010FNO, DIL-RESNET, U-NET-128, U-NET-MOD) across multiple fluid dynamics datasets (INS, CNS, SWE).",
            "method": "Train all models (SineNet-8, F-FNO, DIL-RESNET, U-NET-128, U-NET-MOD) under identical experimental conditions as described in Section 5.1, using consistent data splits and preprocessing for the INS, CNS, and SWE datasets. For each model, conduct both one-step prediction experiments and autoregressive multi-step rollouts extending up to at least T=120 time steps. In the case of CNS, record error metrics for key physical fields such as density, pressure, and velocity components (referencing Figures 11 through 14 for detailed comparisons, and Figure 23 for velocity x). Collect the absolute error values as reported in Table 1 and further detailed in additional tables if available. In addition to quantitative evaluation, apply statistical significance testing (e.g., paired t-tests with a threshold of p < 0.05) to determine if the improvements of SineNet-8 over the baselines are statistically robust. Optionally, complement the numerical errors with visualizations replicating the trends observed in the referenced figures to support the quantitative results.",
            "expected_outcome": "Based on the data provided in Table 1, as well as visual analyses in Figures 11-14 and 23, SineNet-8 is expected to achieve the lowest one-step and rollout errors across the INS, CNS, and SWE datasets. These improvements should be statistically significant compared to baseline models (F\u2010FNO, DIL-RESNET, U-NET-128, U-NET-MOD), confirming the superior performance of SineNet-8 in capturing the dynamics of fluid systems.",

            "hypothesis": "Increasing the number of waves in SineNet by comparing SineNet-8 versus SineNet-16 will reduce prediction errors in one-step and rollout evaluations across the INS, CNS, and SWE datasets due to improved feature representation and increased model capacity.",
            "method": "Train and evaluate two model variants: SineNet-8 and SineNet-16 under identical conditions on the INS, CNS, and SWE datasets. Use the same input\u2013target pair configurations, loss function, and autoregressive rollout evaluation protocol. Specify and maintain consistent training hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, number of epochs, and early-stopping criteria. Record intermediate metrics related to one-step and rollout errors at multiple time steps (see error evolution examples in Figures 11-14 for CNS) and consolidate the results in tables (e.g., Table 1 for one-step errors). Analyze the error differences using appropriate significance tests (such as paired t-tests or Wilcoxon signed-rank tests) to determine if the improvements found with SineNet-16 are statistically significant. Include visualization of training dynamics and error trajectories alongside the summary statistics to provide comprehensive insight into how increased architectural complexity impacts performance.",
            "expected_outcome": "Although the textual summary initially highlights SineNet-8\u2019s performance, preliminary results (as shown in Table 1) indicate that SineNet-16 might yield marginally lower one-step and rollout errors on select datasets. The expected outcome is that SineNet-16 demonstrates a slight but statistically significant improvement in prediction accuracy, thereby justifying the additional architectural complexity. The detailed analysis will clarify whether these improvements are consistent across datasets and evaluation metrics.",

            "method": "Compare SINENET-8 with SINENET-8-ENTANGLED on the INS, CNS, and SWE datasets. For each dataset, record both one-step and rollout error percentages as reported in Table 2. The models must be identically configured in terms of parameter count and training regime. In addition to the quantitative error metrics, perform a qualitative analysis of misalignment in the skip connections. For the CNS dataset, supplement the error analysis by inspecting visualizations of the density and velocity fields (refer to Figures 11, 12, 13, and 14) at T = 120 to better understand how misalignment might affect the prediction performance. Furthermore, include analysis of latent space evolution as discussed in Appendix A.1 (Slowing Down Evolution in Latent Space) to directly evaluate the impact of misalignment on model performance.",
            "expected_outcome": "The results should demonstrate that the disentangled branch in SINENET-8 consistently leads to lower one-step and rollout error percentages compared to SINENET-8-ENTANGLED across all datasets. In particular, the CNS dataset visualizations (Figures 11-14) should correlate lower error metrics with reduced misalignment in skip connections, and the latent space evolution analysis should confirm that disentangling mitigates misalignment issues, thereby enhancing overall prediction accuracy.",

            "hypothesis": "Does increasing the number of waves (K) in SineNet improve prediction accuracy, and if so, does the improvement plateau around K = 16?",
            "method": "Conduct a systematic series of experiments using SineNet models with different numbers of waves (K = 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, and 16). To ensure a fair comparison, keep the total number of parameters approximately constant by adjusting the channel multiplier mK appropriately. Run these experiments on all three datasets (INS, CNS, and SWE). For the CNS dataset in particular, monitor relevant fields such as density, pressure, and velocity components (referencing Figures 11\u201314 which show velocity (x and y), pressure, and density fields downsampled over time with T = 120) to obtain qualitative insights. Record both one-step prediction errors as well as rollout errors over the temporal domain (e.g., using metrics computed at time steps T = 20, 30, \u2026, 120 as illustrated in the figures). Additionally, use any available summarizing tables (e.g., Tables 1\u20135) when applicable to report numeric error metrics. Plot error metrics versus the number of waves (K) to visually assess trends and identify the plateau region.",
            "expected_outcome": "It is expected that as the number of waves increases, prediction errors will monotonically decrease due to the reduction in latent evolution per wave. However, this improvement is anticipated to plateau around K = 16, indicating that further increasing waves yields diminishing returns in prediction accuracy. This behavior should be observable across all datasets (INS, CNS, and SWE), and the CNS experiments should also demonstrate improved qualitative fidelity in the velocity, pressure, and density fields as depicted in Figures 11\u201314.",

Record both one-step and rollout error percentages exactly as described in Table 3. In addition, if available, visualize the error progression over time and compare these metrics to further assess the impact of the padding method on the modeling of advection across boundaries.",
            "expected_outcome": "It is expected that the variant employing circular padding will achieve significantly lower one-step and rollout error percentages compared to zero padding, confirming that incorporating periodic boundary information is essential for accurate simulation of advection phenomena.",

This approach will help in identifying which aspects of the fluid dynamics are more challenging for the model and may guide future architectural improvements.",
