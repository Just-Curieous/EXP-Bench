For each model, conduct both one-step prediction experiments and autoregressive multi-step rollouts extending up to at least T=120 time steps. In the case of CNS, record error metrics for key physical fields such as density, pressure, and velocity components (referencing Figures 11 through 14 for detailed comparisons, and Figure 23 for velocity x). Collect the absolute error values as reported in Table 1 and further detailed in additional tables if available. In addition to quantitative evaluation, apply statistical significance testing (e.g., paired t-tests with a threshold of p < 0.05) to determine if the improvements of SineNet-8 over the baselines are statistically robust. Optionally, complement the numerical errors with visualizations replicating the trends observed in the referenced figures to support the quantitative results.",
