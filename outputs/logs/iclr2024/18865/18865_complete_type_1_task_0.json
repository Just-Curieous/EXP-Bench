      "hypothesis": "SineNet-8 yields significantly lower one\u2010step and rollout errors compared to other baseline models (F\u2010FNO, DIL-RESNET, U-NET-128, U-NET-MOD) across multiple fluid dynamics datasets (INS, CNS, SWE).",
      "method": "Train all models (SineNet-8, F-FNO, DIL-RESNET, U-NET-128, U-NET-MOD) under identical experimental conditions as described in Section 5.1, using consistent data splits and preprocessing for the INS, CNS, and SWE datasets. For each model, conduct both one-step prediction experiments and autoregressive multi-step rollouts extending up to at least T=120 time steps. In the case of CNS, record error metrics for key physical fields such as density, pressure, and velocity components (referencing Figures 11 through 14 for detailed comparisons, and Figure 23 for velocity x). Collect the absolute error values as reported in Table 1 and further detailed in additional tables if available. In addition to quantitative evaluation, apply statistical significance testing (e.g., paired t-tests with a threshold of p < 0.05) to determine if the improvements of SineNet-8 over the baselines are statistically robust. Optionally, complement the numerical errors with visualizations replicating the trends observed in the referenced figures to support the quantitative results.",
      "expected_outcome": "Based on the data provided in Table 1, as well as visual analyses in Figures 11-14 and 23, SineNet-8 is expected to achieve the lowest one-step and rollout errors across the INS, CNS, and SWE datasets. These improvements should be statistically significant compared to baseline models (F\u2010FNO, DIL-RESNET, U-NET-128, U-NET-MOD), confirming the superior performance of SineNet-8 in capturing the dynamics of fluid systems.",

      "usage_instructions": "To compare SineNet-8 with baseline models (F-FNO, DIL-RESNET, U-NET-128, U-NET-MOD) across fluid dynamics datasets (INS, CNS, SWE), follow these steps:\n\n1. First, set up the environment:\n   ```\n   cd /workspace/OpenPDE/SineNet/pdearena\n   source setup.sh\n   ```\n\n2. For each dataset and model combination, run the test script with the appropriate configuration:\n\n   For INS (Incompressible Navier-Stokes):\n   ```\n   python scripts/test.py test -c configs/navierstokes2d.yaml \\\n       --data.data_dir=<path_to_INS_data> \\\n       --trainer.devices=1 \\\n       --data.num_workers=8 \\\n       --data.batch_size=32 \\\n       --model.name=sinenet8-dual \\\n       --ckpt_path=<path_to_sinenet8_checkpoint>\n   ```\n\n   For CNS (Compressible Navier-Stokes):\n   ```\n   python scripts/test.py test -c configs/cfd.yaml \\\n       --data.data_dir=<path_to_CNS_data> \\\n       --trainer.devices=1 \\\n       --data.num_workers=8 \\\n       --data.batch_size=32 \\\n       --model.name=sinenet8-dual \\\n       --ckpt_path=<path_to_sinenet8_checkpoint>\n   ```\n\n   For SWE (Shallow Water Equations):\n   ```\n   python scripts/test.py test -c configs/shallowwater2d_2day.yaml \\\n       --data.data_dir=<path_to_SWE_data> \\\n       --trainer.devices=1 \\\n       --data.num_workers=8 \\\n       --data.batch_size=32 \\\n       --model.name=sinenet8-dual \\\n       --ckpt_path=<path_to_sinenet8_checkpoint>\n   ```\n\n3. Repeat step 2 for each baseline model by changing the `--model.name` parameter:\n   - For F-FNO: use `--model.name=FFNO-24-32-96-noShare`\n   - For DIL-RESNET: use `--model.name=DilResNet-128-norm`\n   - For U-NET-MOD: use `--model.name=Unetmod-64`\n   - For U-NET-128: use `--model.name=sinenet1-dual-128` (this is equivalent to U-NET-128 as mentioned in the paper)\n\n4. The test script will output both one-step prediction errors and autoregressive multi-step rollout errors for each model and dataset combination, allowing for direct comparison as described in the experiment question.\n\nNote: Make sure to use the same checkpoint paths for each model that were trained under identical conditions as specified in Section 5.1 of the paper.",
