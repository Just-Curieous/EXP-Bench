            "method": "Train all the models (SineNet-8, F-FNO, DIL-RESNET, U-NET-128, U-NET-MOD) using the same setup as described in Section 5.1 on the INS, CNS, and SWE datasets. For each model, perform autoregressive rollouts over several time steps as in the original experiments. Record both the one-step test error and the rollout test error. Compare the results quantitatively with a focus on the numbers provided in Table 1. Additionally, apply statistical significance testing (e.g., paired t-tests on the error metrics) to reliably assess whether SineNet-8 outperforms the baselines.",
            "expected_outcome": "Based on the paper\u2019s description and the data in Table 1, SineNet-8 is expected to have the lowest errors\u2014both one-step and rollout\u2014across all three datasets, thus outperforming all other baseline models.",

            "hypothesis": "Increasing the number of waves in SineNet (i.e., moving from SineNet-8 to SineNet-16) further reduces prediction errors in both one-step and rollout evaluations across the datasets.",
            "method": "Train two variants of the model, SineNet-8 and SineNet-16, under identical conditions on the INS, CNS and SWE datasets. Use the same training regime (input\u2013target pair configurations, loss function, and autoregressive rollout evaluation). After training, record the one-step and rollout errors for each dataset as done in the experiments (see Table 1). Analyze the error differences and use appropriate significance tests to determine if the improvements with SineNet-16 over SineNet-8 are statistically significant.",
            "expected_outcome": "Although the textual summary highlights SineNet-8\u2019s performance, Table 1 shows that SineNet-16 has slightly lower one-step and rollout errors on some datasets. It is expected that SineNet-16 might demonstrate marginally improved performance; however, the experiment will clarify whether the additional architectural complexity translates to robust, statistically significant gains.",

            "hypothesis": "Does disentangling the parallel branch in SineNet (i.e., using a disentangled downsampling configuration) improve performance over an entangled architecture?",
            "method": "Compare SINENET-8 with SINENET-8-ENTANGLED on the INS, CNS, and SWE datasets. For each dataset, record both one-step and rollout error percentages as reported in Table 2. The experiment should ensure the models are otherwise identically configured (same number of parameters and training regime). Analyze the error metrics to determine whether the performance gains are consistent across all datasets, with particular attention to the impact of misalignment issues in skip connections.",
            "expected_outcome": "The results should show that the disentangled branch in SINENET-8 leads to lower error values compared to SINENET-8-ENTANGLED, confirming that disentangling the parallel and sequential processing branches mitigates misalignment and enhances prediction accuracy.",

            "hypothesis": "Does increasing the number of waves (K) in SineNet improve prediction accuracy, and if so, does the improvement plateau around K = 16?",
            "method": "Conduct a series of experiments using SineNet models configured with different numbers of waves (e.g., K = 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, and 16) while keeping the overall number of parameters approximately constant (by adjusting the channel multiplier mK appropriately). Run these experiments on all three datasets (INS, CNS, and SWE) and measure both one-step and rollout errors at each configuration. Plot the error metrics versus the number of waves to visually inspect the trend and determine the plateau region.",
            "expected_outcome": "It is expected that errors will monotonically decrease as the number of waves increases, thanks to the reduced latent evolution per wave. However, the improvements should plateau around K = 16, indicating that further increases in K yield diminishing returns in prediction accuracy.",

            "hypothesis": "Does using circular padding for SineNet on datasets with periodic boundary conditions (like SWE) result in lower prediction errors compared to using zero padding?",
            "method": "Implement SineNet-8 on the SWE dataset twice: once using circular padding (which encodes periodic boundary conditions) and once using zero padding. Ensure all other configurations remain identical. Record both one-step and rollout error percentages as shown in Table 3. Compare the performance metrics to assess the impact of the padding method on the modeling of advection across boundaries.",
            "expected_outcome": "The experiment should reveal that circular padding provides significantly lower error values compared to zero padding on the SWE dataset, confirming that incorporating the periodic boundary information into the network is essential for accurate simulation of advection phenomena.",

For each field component, perform time series analysis of the errors across the simulation steps and assess correlation metrics between individual field errors and the overall simulation accuracy. This approach will help in identifying which aspects of the fluid dynamics are more challenging for the model and may guide future architectural improvements.",

        "The paper introduces a method (referred to as SineNet) that slows down the evolution in latent space to improve the alignment between predicted and ground truth simulation variables.",

        "The evaluation includes time-stepped comparisons (e.g., t = 20 to t = 120) where predicted values closely follow ground truth data, indicating that the proposed approach maintains consistency even over long prediction horizons.",
        "Quantitative results show that the absolute error remains controlled (with error values like 0.2 or lower for velocity and small percentage errors for other fields) when using the latent space slowdown technique.",
        "The experimental results, depicted in multiple figures (Figures 11\u201314), underline the effectiveness of the approach across various simulation metrics and demonstrate its potential for improving predictive performance in complex dynamical systems."
