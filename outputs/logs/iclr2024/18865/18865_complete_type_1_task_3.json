      "hypothesis": "Does increasing the number of waves (K) in SineNet improve prediction accuracy, and if so, does the improvement plateau around K = 16?",
      "method": "Conduct a systematic series of experiments using SineNet models with different numbers of waves (K = 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, and 16). To ensure a fair comparison, keep the total number of parameters approximately constant by adjusting the channel multiplier mK appropriately. Run these experiments on all three datasets (INS, CNS, and SWE). For the CNS dataset in particular, monitor relevant fields such as density, pressure, and velocity components (referencing Figures 11\u201314 which show velocity (x and y), pressure, and density fields downsampled over time with T = 120) to obtain qualitative insights. Record both one-step prediction errors as well as rollout errors over the temporal domain (e.g., using metrics computed at time steps T = 20, 30, \u2026, 120 as illustrated in the figures). Additionally, use any available summarizing tables (e.g., Tables 1\u20135) when applicable to report numeric error metrics. Plot error metrics versus the number of waves (K) to visually assess trends and identify the plateau region.",
      "expected_outcome": "It is expected that as the number of waves increases, prediction errors will monotonically decrease due to the reduction in latent evolution per wave. However, this improvement is anticipated to plateau around K = 16, indicating that further increasing waves yields diminishing returns in prediction accuracy. This behavior should be observable across all datasets (INS, CNS, and SWE), and the CNS experiments should also demonstrate improved qualitative fidelity in the velocity, pressure, and density fields as depicted in Figures 11\u201314.",

      "usage_instructions": "To conduct the ablation study on the effect of increasing the number of waves (K) in SineNet, use the following steps:\n\n1. First, set up the environment:\n   ```\n   cd /workspace/OpenPDE/SineNet/pdearena\n   source setup.sh\n   ```\n\n2. For each dataset (INS, CNS, SWE) and each K value (2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16), train a SineNet model using the train.py script. The repository already has model configurations for K=2, 4, 6, 8 in the registry.py file with appropriate channel multipliers (mK) to keep the parameter count approximately constant. For K=10, 12, 14, 16, you would need to add similar configurations with adjusted multipliers.\n\n   For example, to train on the INS dataset with K=2:\n   ```\n   python scripts/train.py -c configs/navierstokes2d.yaml \\\n       --data.data_dir=<data_dir> \\\n       --data.num_workers=8 \\\n       --data.batch_size=32 \\\n       --model.name=sinenet2-dual \\\n       --model.lr=2e-4 --optimizer.lr=2e-4\n   ```\n\n   For CNS dataset with K=4:\n   ```\n   python scripts/train.py -c configs/cfd.yaml \\\n       --data.data_dir=<data_dir> \\\n       --data.num_workers=8 \\\n       --data.batch_size=32 \\\n       --model.name=sinenet4-dual \\\n       --model.lr=2e-4 --optimizer.lr=2e-4\n   ```\n\n   For SWE dataset with K=8:\n   ```\n   python scripts/train.py -c configs/shallowwater2d_2day.yaml \\\n       --data.data_dir=<data_dir> \\\n       --data.num_workers=8 \\\n       --data.batch_size=32 \\\n       --model.name=sinenet8-dual \\\n       --model.lr=2e-4 --optimizer.lr=2e-4\n   ```\n\n3. After training, test each model using the test.py script to collect one-step prediction errors and rollout errors:\n   ```\n   python scripts/test.py test -c configs/<config>.yaml \\\n       --data.data_dir=<data_dir> \\\n       --trainer.devices=1 \\\n       --data.num_workers=8 \\\n       --data.batch_size=32 \\\n       --model.name=<model_name> \\\n       --ckpt_path=<ckpt_path>\n   ```\n\n4. The test results will include both one-step prediction errors and rollout errors over the temporal domain. For the CNS dataset, the results will include metrics for density, pressure, and velocity components as mentioned in the experiment question.\n\n5. After collecting all the results, plot the error metrics versus the number of waves (K) to visually assess trends and identify the plateau region around K=16.\n\nNote: The existing model registry already includes configurations for SineNet with K=2, 4, 6, 8 with appropriate channel multipliers to keep the parameter count approximately constant. For K=10, 12, 14, 16, you would need to add similar configurations to the registry with adjusted multipliers following the same pattern.",
