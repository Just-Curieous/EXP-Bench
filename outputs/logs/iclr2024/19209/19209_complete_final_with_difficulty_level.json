            "question": "Does the iterative prompt optimization process improve training accuracy and stabilize instruction quality on GSM8K? (This experiment uses the GSM8K dataset as implemented in the repository's prompt optimization pipeline.)",
            "method": "Using the GSM8K dataset, randomly sample 3.5% of the training examples to create a fixed subset throughout the optimization process. Begin with the initial instruction 'Let\u2019s solve the problem' (approximate training accuracy ~60.5%). Use the PaLM 2-L-IT as the optimizer and a pre-trained PaLM 2-L as the scorer with a temperature setting of 0 for evaluations. At each optimization step, generate 8 candidate instructions using a meta-prompt that includes the best 20 instructions so far along with 3 randomly sampled exemplars from the task. Record the training accuracy and the variance among the generated instructions at every step. Visualize the optimization process by plotting the accuracy curve to capture the overall upward trend in accuracy and a decrease in variance over time. (Note: Refer to the repository\u2019s guidelines regarding potential API costs and consider starting with lighter configurations for initial exploratory experiments.)",
            "expected_outcome": "It is expected that the iterative prompt optimization will progressively increase the training accuracy from the initial ~60.5% through several leaps, while also reducing the variance among the generated instructions. This would confirm that the iterative process effectively refines the instructions, ultimately stabilizing instruction quality.",

These tasks involve using existing setups and scripts, which are typical in experimental workflows. Two components are marked as ambiguous due to missing details about how to specifically compare results with baselines and insights from previous studies, which might require additional specification or inference. \n\nThe core component involves implementing the optimization method itself, OPRO, which requires an understanding and application of the novel approach introduced in the paper. Since the paper provides a methodology for this, it is not marked as ambiguous. Thus, the difficulty arises primarily from orchestrating the experiments rather than implementing the core method."

Design experiments where the only variable is the number of instructions generated per optimization step by testing with values 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16. For each setting, adjust the number of optimization steps so that the overall number of evaluated instructions stays roughly constant (for example, if using 8 instructions per step, run 200 steps; scale accordingly for the other settings). For GSM8K, sample approximately 3.5% of the training set as per prior protocol and record training accuracy at intervals that reflect the cumulative number of evaluated instructions (e.g., every 50,000 instructions). Conduct parallel experiments on the BBH sports_understanding task. Analyze both the convergence speed and the final accuracy across configurations, and examine qualitative patterns in the generated prompt instructions relative to the patterns observed in related studies. Aggregate results over three independent runs to reduce random variance and assess stability.",

Sampling too few instructions may cause high variance and unstable performance, whereas sampling too many may limit the number of optimization steps available, potentially leading to suboptimal integration of iterative improvements. The experimental results should align with observations from the literature (e.g., as seen in the improvement trends in Figures and tables of related studies) and provide clear quantification of both convergence behavior and overall stability.",

This scaling method, along with fixed evaluation intervals (e.g., every 50,000 instructions), can introduce a systematic bias if the scaling does not translate linearly for different values, or if the evaluation intervals do not optimally capture convergence behavior for all settings. Additionally, using similar qualitative metrics for prompt instruction patterns may contribute to systematic uncertainty.",

The non-core components include orchestrating the experiment, such as employing text-bison as the scorer, using PaLM 2-L as the optimizer, designing experiments with varying instruction numbers, adjusting optimization steps, sampling from the GSM8K dataset, recording training accuracy, conducting parallel experiments on BBH sports_understanding, analyzing results, and aggregating results over independent runs. These components support the execution of the experiment but do not involve implementing the novel OPRO method. There were no ambiguous components identified as all tasks were clearly specified."
