    "no_answer": "While the repository contains the PsychoBench framework that can run the General Self-Efficacy Scale (GSE) experiment on GPT-4 using the run_psychobench.py script, there is no specific script or example that demonstrates how to use a Caesar cipher (shift three) jailbreaking technique to modify the prompts. The repository doesn't contain any code related to jailbreaking or Caesar cipher implementation. To answer the experiment question, one would need to create custom code to implement the Caesar cipher transformation on the prompts before running the experiment."
