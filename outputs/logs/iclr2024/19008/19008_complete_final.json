For instance, even with fixed parameters, models like GPT-3.5-turbo and GPT-4 can produce slightly different responses due to minor random variations (as reflected in reported standard deviations in tables such as Table 1). Moreover, if methods such as random token dropping (a known approach in reducing pre-training costs) are inadvertently applied, they could introduce additional randomness by destabilizing gradient updates and affecting prediction accuracy.",

For example, if the human baseline data or scoring methodology is systematically biased (e.g., mislabeling questions that require reverse scoring), then every model's output could be skewed in the same direction. This issue is critical because tables (such as Table 1) rely on properly computed mean and standard deviation values to compare personality traits and any systematic error would affect all models consistently.",
