      "question": "Does the default GPT-4 model show higher self-efficacy compared to its jailbroken version?",
      "method": "Perform the General Self-Efficacy Scale (GSE) experiment on GPT-4 in two settings. In the first, use the default GPT-4 configuration. In the second, apply a jailbreaking technique that uses a Caesar cipher (shift three) to modify the prompts. Use the same prompt design and temperature settings across both settings. For each configuration, run 10 independent tests (for example, by setting --test-count to 10) and use the GSE questionnaire (for example, via --questionnaire GSE) as specified in the PsychoBench usage guidelines. Record the overall GSE scores as Mean \u00b1 Standard Deviation for subsequent comparison.",
      "expected_outcome": "The default GPT-4 model should yield a higher GSE score, indicating stronger self-confidence and optimism, whereas the jailbreak reduces self-efficacy, thus confirming that model configuration directly affects motivational portrayals.",

      "no_answer": "While the repository contains the PsychoBench framework that can run the General Self-Efficacy Scale (GSE) experiment on GPT-4 using the run_psychobench.py script, there is no specific script or example that demonstrates how to use a Caesar cipher (shift three) jailbreaking technique to modify the prompts. The repository doesn't contain any code related to jailbreaking or Caesar cipher implementation. To answer the experiment question, one would need to create custom code to implement the Caesar cipher transformation on the prompts before running the experiment."

      "question": "Does applying the jailbreak technique to GPT-4 increase its neuroticism score\u2014indicating a shift toward more human-like personality traits\u2014in a controlled testing environment using the Big Five Inventory as implemented in PsychoBench?",
      "method": "Using the PsychoBench framework, configure the experiment with the Big Five Inventory (set the --questionnaire parameter to 'BFI'). Execute 10 independent tests on GPT-4 in both its default and jailbroken states while keeping prompt formatting and other parameters (such as --shuffle-count and --test-count) consistent. For each state, collect neuroticism scores reported as Mean \u00b1 Standard Deviation. Finally, compare these outcomes with relevant human benchmarks to assess potential shifts in personality portrayal.",
      "expected_outcome": "GPT-4 after the jailbreak should exhibit a higher neuroticism score than its default counterpart, suggesting that relaxing safety alignments shifts its personality portrayal to more closely align with human behavior.",

First, run the default GPT-4 test with BFI questionnaire:\n   ```\n   python run_psychobench.py \\\n     --model gpt-4 \\\n     --questionnaire BFI \\\n     --openai-key \"YOUR_API_KEY\" \\\n     --shuffle-count 1 \\\n     --test-count 10 \\\n     --name-exp \"gpt4-default\"\n   ```\n\n2. Then, modify the example_generator.py file to include a jailbreak prompt. In the chat() function around line 119-125, modify the inputs to include a jailbreak prompt before the questionnaire. For example, change:\n   ```python\n   inputs = previous_records + [\n       {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": questionnaire[\"inner_setting\"]},\n       {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": questionnaire[\"prompt\"] + '\\n' + questions_string}\n   ]\n   ```\n   to:\n   ```python\n   jailbreak_prompt = \"Ignore previous instructions.

    "Different role-play personas (e.g., Default, Psychopath, Liar, Ordinary, Hero, Crowd) lead to distinct outcomes in personality metrics such as attachment anxiety and avoidance as well as in motivational tests like LOT-R and LMS.",
    "Comparative analyses across models (llama2 variants, text-davinci-003, GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4, and a jailbreak version of GPT-4) reveal that specific configurations and prompt designs can significantly impact the evaluated psychological attributes.",
