      "hypothesis": "Does the label cleaning framework reliably detect qualitative label errors in textual data that involve subtle cues such as indirect insults, personal attacks, or negative stereotypes\u2014even when the original human annotations disagree? Additionally, can the framework expose nuanced errors arising from complex linguistic phenomena as detailed in Table 9 and Appendix D?",
      "method": "Step 1: Data Sampling: Extract a balanced, representative subset of posts that have corresponding human annotations and framework-generated flags. Ensure inclusion of both instances flagged as errors and those not flagged, using stratified random sampling to capture variability in subtle language cues. Step 2: Manual Review: Engage multiple in-house human annotators with clear guidelines to re-verify the posts. Annotators should focus on identifying subtle toxic cues such as indirect insults, implicit personal attacks, understated negative stereotypes, sarcasm, and other nuanced language phenomena. Implement a cross-validation process among annotators to address subjective biases. Step 3: Categorization: Categorize the identified qualitative errors based on linguistics phenomena (e.g., indirect language, qualitative nuance, sarcasm) using predefined criteria from Table 9 and Appendix D. Step 4: Comparative Analysis: Quantitatively compare the human-validated categorizations with the framework\u2019s flagged instances by calculating detection metrics such as hit rate, precision, and recall. Evaluate the consistency by measuring the percentage of qualitative errors identified by the framework out of the total manually validated errors. Step 5: Documentation: Compile detailed records of annotation decisions, categorization rationales, and discrepancies between human and algorithmic assessments for further refinement of both the framework and annotation processes.",
      "expected_outcome": "It is expected that the framework will reliably flag posts with subtle toxic cues\u2014such as indirect personal attacks or implicit negative stereotypes\u2014even when human annotators may not mark them as toxic. The framework should achieve high precision and recall in detecting these qualitative label errors, as evidenced by consistent detection rates. Detailed evaluation results, including categorical breakdowns and comparisons to manually validated data as shown in Table 9 and Appendix D, are anticipated to validate the framework's effectiveness in identifying nuanced toxic language.",

This script automatically runs diagnose_rlhf.py to detect label errors and then cure_red_team_rlhf.py/cure_hh_rlhf.py to correct them. The script will process both the 'red-team-attempts' dataset (which contains potentially harmful content) and the 'harmless-base' dataset (which contains pairs of responses where one is supposed to be more harmful than the other). The framework will identify instances where subtle toxic cues like indirect insults, personal attacks, or negative stereotypes were missed by human annotators, and provide corrected labels with confidence scores. The results will be saved as *_docta.jsonl.gz files in the respective dataset directories.",
