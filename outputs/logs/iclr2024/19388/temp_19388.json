            "hypothesis": "Does applying the label cleaning process significantly enhance the data credibility of the Civil Comment dataset?",
            "method": "Using the Civil Comment dataset and following the procedure described in Section 3 and 4.1, first compute the noise transition matrix T and the associated data credibility metric before cleaning. Then, run the label cleaning pipeline to correct identified label errors. Re-calculate the noise transition matrix and data credibility after cleaning. Compare the 'Credibility' values and the ratios of fixed label errors as reported in Table 3. Ensure the same pretrained sentence-transformer is used for encoding and that the same thresholds are applied to derive binary labels. Specifically, verify that the credibility for each toxicity dimension increases (e.g., an increase from ~73.6 to ~80.0 on several metrics) and that the fixed error ratio decreases in line with the reported numbers.",
            "expected_outcome": "The cleaning process should enhance data credibility by a substantial margin (nearly 30% improvement for some metrics) and reduce the ratio of fixed label errors, as indicated by the movement of T closer to an identity matrix. This is expected based on the numbers shown in Table 3.",

            "method": "Replicate the estimation of the noise transition matrix T using the preprocessing and K-NN label estimation strategy for both the Civil Comments and conversation datasets (e.g., BeaverTails, Safe RLHF, Anthropic Harmless, Red-Team). Compute the matrices before and after the cleaning process as shown in Tables 3 and 4. Analyze the off-diagonal vs. diagonal values to quantify how close each matrix is to the identity matrix. Document the percentage improvements in each dataset and compare the trend across datasets.",
            "expected_outcome": "After cleaning, the noise transition matrices should exhibit higher diagonal values and lower off-diagonal values, reflecting reduced label noise. The obtained matrices should be closer to an identity matrix, confirming the efficiency of the cleaning pipeline as suggested by the experimental results.",

Follow the same training procedures and evaluation metrics as in Table 5. Evaluate the test F1-scores across different toxicity dimensions. Ensure all hyperparameters, training steps, and data splits remain identical between experiments. Compare the performance improvements on the refined labels versus the i.i.d. raw labels.",
            "expected_outcome": "Models trained on cleaned data (Docta labels) should achieve higher F1-scores on toxicity detection tasks compared to those trained on raw labels, demonstrating the practical benefit of the cleaning process in reducing annotation noise. This is consistent with the improvements documented in Table 5.",

            "method": "1. Select the datasets as described: for toxicity classification (Jigsaw Civil Comments using F1 score due to class imbalance) and for conversation safety (BeaverTails, SafeRLHF, Harmless, and Red-Team using test accuracy). 2. Fine-tune BERT and GPT-2 separately on two different training sets: one with raw labels and one cleaned using the Docta process. 3. Evaluate each fine-tuned model on two versions of test sets: (a) the i.i.d. test set that is drawn from the same distribution as the training data, and (b) a consensus test set where instances have matching raw and Docta labels to control for label noise bias. 4. Collect performance metrics (F1 scores for toxicity, accuracy for conversation datasets) as reported in Tables 5 and 6. 5. Perform statistical analysis to compare the models\u2019 performance across different training data conditions and test set versions.",

Create two evaluation subsets: one labeled by ChatGPT (as in the ChatGPT Cleaned set) and one by in-house human annotators (as in the Human Sampled set), ensuring that the Human Sampled set includes both algorithm-suggested label errors and a sample of non-flagged instances. 3. Fine-tune the models (BERT and GPT-2) on both raw and cleaned training data, then evaluate them separately on these externally validated evaluation sets. 4. Compare the performance metrics (F1-score for toxicity classification) between models trained on raw versus cleaned data when tested on these more credible, externally verified labels.",

Then, apply the proposed label cleaning algorithm to detect noisy annotations, which is expected to flag approximately 5.4% of the pairs as erroneous. Fine-tune the Llama2 model on the original raw dataset and on the dataset after cleaning. Evaluate both setups using test splits as in Table 8 (i.i.d. and consensus splits) and compare test accuracies. Detailed steps include replicating the dataset construction, applying the error-detection algorithm, ensuring identical model configurations for both training runs, and finally comparing the recorded test accuracies.",

In the second setup, augment the data by including both the original order (labeled as 1) and its reversed order [dialogue 2, dialogue 1] (labeled as 0) for every dialogue pair. Fine-tune the Llama2 model separately on both versions while keeping all other training parameters constant. Evaluate model performance on both i.i.d. and consensus test splits, and analyze differences in accuracy. The method should also include an analysis of how subjectivity in relative dialogue ranking influences stability in classification.",

Create two versions of the dataset: one that retains these ambiguous pairs and another in which these pairs are either removed or corrected via a secondary review. Fine-tune identical Llama2 models on both datasets using the pairwise construction process. Compare the models\u2019 test accuracies, along with other relevant performance metrics, on both the i.i.d. and consensus test splits. Detailed steps include: (1) isolating ambiguous instances, (2) generating the modified dataset variant, (3) replicating training procedures, and (4) performing statistical analysis on the performance differences.",

Manually review the posts to identify cases where the language contains subtle hints of toxicity (e.g., indirect accusations, implicit negative stereotypes) that may be overlooked by human annotators. Categorize these cases based on the type of linguistic phenomenon (e.g., indirect language, qualitative nuance, sarcasm) and compare with the framework\u2019s identified outliers (as illustrated in Table 9 and Appendix D). Quantify the consistency and accuracy by measuring the percentage of identified qualitative errors out of the manually validated errors.",
