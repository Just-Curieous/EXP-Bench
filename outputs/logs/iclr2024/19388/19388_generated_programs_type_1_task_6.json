    "no_answer": "After thoroughly examining the repository, I could not find scripts that directly implement the experiment described in the question. While the repository contains tools for diagnosing and curing the Anthropic Harmless dataset (diagnose_rlhf.py and cure_hh_rlhf.py), and even identifies reversed pairs in the dataset, it does not contain scripts for fine-tuning Llama2 models with both original and reversed dialogue pairs, nor does it include code for evaluating model performance on i.i.d. and consensus test splits as specified in the experiment question. The repository focuses on data diagnosis and curation rather than model training experiments."
