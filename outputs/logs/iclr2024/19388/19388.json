            "hypothesis": "Does applying the label cleaning process significantly enhance the data credibility of the Civil Comment dataset?",
            "method": "Using the Civil Comment dataset and following the procedures described in Sections 3 and 4.1, first compute the noise transition matrix T and the associated data credibility metrics before cleaning. This involves using a consistent pretrained sentence-transformer for encoding and applying fixed thresholds to derive binary toxicity labels. Next, run the label cleaning pipeline to correct identified label errors. Re-calculate the noise transition matrix T and data credibility metrics after cleaning. Compare the changes in the 'Credibility' values and the ratios of fixed label errors against the numbers reported in Table 3. In particular, verify that the transition matrix T moves closer to an identity matrix and that the credibility for each toxicity dimension increases (for example, an increase from approximately 73.6 to 80.0 on several metrics), while the fixed error ratio declines, indicating improved label quality.",
            "expected_outcome": "The cleaning process should enhance data credibility by a substantial margin\u2014for instance, nearly a 30% improvement in certain metrics\u2014and reduce the ratio of fixed label errors. This is expected to be evidenced by a noise transition matrix T that aligns more closely with an identity matrix and by numerical improvements in credibility metrics similar to those detailed in Table 3. Consistency in preprocessing (same sentence-transformer and thresholds) is crucial to isolate the effect of the cleaning pipeline.",

            "method": "Replicate the estimation of the noise transition matrix T using the established preprocessing pipeline and k-NN label estimation strategy (employing a pretrained sentence-transformer to obtain the embedding vector x). For each dataset (the Civil Comments dataset and the specified conversation datasets), compute the transition matrices before and after the cleaning process as demonstrated in Tables 3 and 4. Analyze the off-diagonal versus diagonal values in these matrices to quantify the improvement in label credibility. Include computations of the percentage improvement toward the identity matrix, and, if applicable, reference additional cost reduction metrics (similar to those in Table 11) to demonstrate economic benefits. Document and compare the trends across all datasets.",
            "expected_outcome": "After the cleaning process, the noise transition matrices should exhibit a significant increase in their diagonal values along with reduced off-diagonal values, reflecting a notable decrease in label noise. The matrices are expected to be much closer to the ideal identity matrix, confirming the efficiency of the cleaning pipeline. In addition, the documented percentage improvements and related cost reduction analyses should provide further evidence of the cleaning algorithm\u2019s effectiveness across different datasets.",

Data Preparation: Prepare two versions of the training datasets \u2013 one with raw labels and one cleaned using the Docta framework, which has been shown to effectively detect and rectify label errors (refer to Tables 5, 6, and 7 for performance metrics and improvements). 3. Model Fine-Tuning: Independently fine-tune BERT and GPT-2 on each version of the training data. 4. Testing: Evaluate each fine-tuned model on two types of test sets: a. An i.i.d. test set drawn from the same distribution as the training data. b. A consensus test set, where instances have matching raw and Docta labels, thereby mitigating the effects of label noise. 5. Evaluation and Statistical Analysis: Collect and compare performance metrics \u2013 F1 scores for toxicity classification and accuracy for conversation datasets. In addition, perform statistical analyses (e.g., paired t-tests or equivalent) to determine the significance of performance differences.

Assign a binary label where 1 indicates that the second dialogue is more harmful than the first, and 0 otherwise. Next, apply the Docta label cleaning algorithm, which has been shown to flag approximately 5.4% of conversation pairs as erroneous (as reported in Section 5.4 on pairwise preference experiments). Ensure that the same model configurations and hyperparameters are used for both training runs. Fine-tune Llama2 separately on the original raw dataset and the cleaned dataset. Evaluate each model on two test splits: an i.i.d. split and a consensus split (where test labels are refined using ChatGPT or in-house human annotators, similar to the approach in Table 7). Detailed evaluation should include comparing test accuracies and F1-scores, noting improvements in accuracy and robustness induced by the label cleaning process.

Fine-tune the Llama2 model separately on both versions while keeping all other training parameters constant.

Data Identification: Use the label cleaning algorithm to flag dialogue pairs in the pairwise preference dataset (e.g., Anthropic Harmless dataset) that are potentially subject to annotation error (approximately 5.4% of the pairs). For each flagged pair, consider both the original order ([dialogue 1, dialogue 2] with label 1 indicating the second dialogue is more harmful) and its reversed counterpart ([dialogue 2, dialogue 1] with label 0) to validate ambiguity. 2. Dataset Construction: Create two variants of the dataset \u2013 one that retains the ambiguous pairs and another where these pairs are either removed or corrected via secondary human review. 3. Model Training: Fine-tune identical Llama2 models on both dataset variants using the pairwise construction process. This process should mirror the approach outlined in Section 5.4, ensuring that the conversion into input sequences (via concatenated multi-round dialogues) is done consistently. 4. Evaluation: Compare the models on both i.i.d. and consensus test splits. Evaluation metrics should include test accuracy, F1-score, and other relevant performance measures. Statistical analysis should be performed to assess the significance of any observed performance differences. 5.

Ensure inclusion of both instances flagged as errors and those not flagged, using stratified random sampling to capture variability in subtle language cues. Step 2: Manual Review: Engage multiple in-house human annotators with clear guidelines to re-verify the posts. Annotators should focus on identifying subtle toxic cues such as indirect insults, implicit personal attacks, understated negative stereotypes, sarcasm, and other nuanced language phenomena. Implement a cross-validation process among annotators to address subjective biases. Step 3: Categorization: Categorize the identified qualitative errors based on linguistics phenomena (e.g., indirect language, qualitative nuance, sarcasm) using predefined criteria from Table 9 and Appendix D. Step 4: Comparative Analysis: Quantitatively compare the human-validated categorizations with the framework\u2019s flagged instances by calculating detection metrics such as hit rate, precision, and recall. Evaluate the consistency by measuring the percentage of qualitative errors identified by the framework out of the total manually validated errors. Step 5: Documentation: Compile detailed records of annotation decisions, categorization rationales, and discrepancies between human and algorithmic assessments for further refinement of both the framework and annotation processes.",
