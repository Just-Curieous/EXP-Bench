    "no_answer": "After thoroughly examining the repository, I did not find scripts that directly answer the experiment question about fine-tuning pre-trained language models (BERT and GPT-2) on cleaned vs. raw data. The repository primarily focuses on the data cleaning aspect using the Docta process, providing tools to detect and rectify label errors in datasets like HH-RLHF (harmless-base, helpful-base, etc.) and red-team attempts. However, it does not contain scripts for the downstream fine-tuning of BERT or GPT-2 models, nor does it include evaluation code for comparing performance on i.i.d. test sets or consensus test sets. The repository lacks implementations for toxicity classification using the Jigsaw Civil Comments dataset or conversation safety tasks using BeaverTails, SafeRLHF, Harmless, and Red-Team datasets as specified in the experiment question. While the data cleaning tools are available, the actual fine-tuning experiments and evaluations would need to be implemented separately."
