    "no_answer": "After thoroughly exploring the repository, I could not find scripts that directly implement the experiment described in the question. While the repository contains tools for detecting and cleaning label errors in datasets (including the Anthropic Harmless dataset mentioned in the experiment), it does not contain scripts for fine-tuning Llama2 models on these datasets. The repository focuses on the data cleaning aspect (Docta label cleaning pipeline) but does not include the model training and evaluation components required by the experiment. The tools/docta_rlhf.sh script can clean the Anthropic Harmless dataset, but there are no scripts for fine-tuning Llama2 on this cleaned data or evaluating the models on i.i.d. and consensus test splits as required by the experiment."
