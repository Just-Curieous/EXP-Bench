    "no_answer": "After thoroughly examining the repository, I could not find scripts that specifically address the experiment question about training toxicity detection models (BERT and GPT2) on the Civil Comments dataset using both raw and cleaned labels. The repository contains tools for detecting and correcting label errors in various datasets (including text data from Anthropic's RLHF dataset), but it does not include: 1) any reference to the Civil Comments dataset, 2) scripts for fine-tuning BERT or GPT2 on toxicity detection tasks, or 3) evaluation scripts that compare performance between models trained on raw vs. cleaned labels as described in Table 5. The repository is primarily focused on the data cleaning methodology (Docta) rather than the downstream task evaluation mentioned in the experiment question."
