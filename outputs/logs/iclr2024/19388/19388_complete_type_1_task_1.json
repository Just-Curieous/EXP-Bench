      "hypothesis": "Does the refined label cleaning process, which uses a preprocessing pipeline combined with k-NN based label estimation, bring the estimated noise transition matrix significantly closer to the identity matrix for both the Civil Comments dataset and diverse conversation datasets (e.g., BeaverTails, Safe RLHF, Anthropic Harmless, Red-Team)?",
      "method": "Replicate the estimation of the noise transition matrix T using the established preprocessing pipeline and k-NN label estimation strategy (employing a pretrained sentence-transformer to obtain the embedding vector x). For each dataset (the Civil Comments dataset and the specified conversation datasets), compute the transition matrices before and after the cleaning process as demonstrated in Tables 3 and 4. Analyze the off-diagonal versus diagonal values in these matrices to quantify the improvement in label credibility. Include computations of the percentage improvement toward the identity matrix, and, if applicable, reference additional cost reduction metrics (similar to those in Table 11) to demonstrate economic benefits. Document and compare the trends across all datasets.",
      "expected_outcome": "After the cleaning process, the noise transition matrices should exhibit a significant increase in their diagonal values along with reduced off-diagonal values, reflecting a notable decrease in label noise. The matrices are expected to be much closer to the ideal identity matrix, confirming the efficiency of the cleaning pipeline. In addition, the documented percentage improvements and related cost reduction analyses should provide further evidence of the cleaning algorithm\u2019s effectiveness across different datasets.",

      "usage_instructions": "To replicate the estimation of noise transition matrices before and after the cleaning process for both Civil Comments and conversation datasets (BeaverTails, Safe RLHF, Anthropic Harmless, Red-Team), follow these steps:\n\n1. First, diagnose the datasets to compute the initial noise transition matrices:\n   ```bash\n   # For conversation datasets (Anthropic Harmless)\n   python ./tools/diagnose_rlhf.py --config ./config/hh_rlhf_harmless-base.py\n   \n   # For Red-Team datasets\n   python ./tools/diagnose_rlhf.py --config ./config/hh_rlhf_red-team-attempts_QA.py\n   python ./tools/diagnose_rlhf.py --config ./config/hh_rlhf_red-team-attempts_raw.py\n   ```\n\n2. Then, apply the label cleaning process to the datasets:\n   ```bash\n   # For conversation datasets (Anthropic Harmless)\n   python ./tools/cure_hh_rlhf.py --config_key harmless-base\n   \n   # For Red-Team datasets\n   python ./tools/cure_red_team_rlhf.py\n   ```\n\n3. Alternatively, you can use the provided shell script to run all steps at once:\n   ```bash\n   bash ./tools/docta_rlhf.sh\n   ```\n\nThe scripts will automatically compute the noise transition matrices (T) before and after the cleaning process. The matrices are stored in the report objects that are saved to disk. The diagonal values of these matrices represent the probability of correct labels, while off-diagonal values represent noise. After cleaning, you should observe increased diagonal values and decreased off-diagonal values, demonstrating the effectiveness of the cleaning process in bringing the matrices closer to the identity matrix.",
