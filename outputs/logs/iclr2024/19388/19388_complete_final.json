            "method": "Using the Civil Comment dataset and following the procedures described in Sections 3 and 4.1, first compute the noise transition matrix T and the associated data credibility metrics before cleaning. This involves using a consistent pretrained sentence-transformer for encoding and applying fixed thresholds to derive binary toxicity labels. Next, run the label cleaning pipeline to correct identified label errors. Re-calculate the noise transition matrix T and data credibility metrics after cleaning. Compare the changes in the 'Credibility' values and the ratios of fixed label errors against the numbers reported in Table 3. In particular, verify that the transition matrix T moves closer to an identity matrix and that the credibility for each toxicity dimension increases (for example, an increase from approximately 73.6 to 80.0 on several metrics), while the fixed error ratio declines, indicating improved label quality.",
            "expected_outcome": "The cleaning process should enhance data credibility by a substantial margin\u2014for instance, nearly a 30% improvement in certain metrics\u2014and reduce the ratio of fixed label errors. This is expected to be evidenced by a noise transition matrix T that aligns more closely with an identity matrix and by numerical improvements in credibility metrics similar to those detailed in Table 3. Consistency in preprocessing (same sentence-transformer and thresholds) is crucial to isolate the effect of the cleaning pipeline.",

Next, apply the Docta label cleaning algorithm, which has been shown to flag approximately 5.4% of conversation pairs as erroneous (as reported in Section 5.4 on pairwise preference experiments). Ensure that the same model configurations and hyperparameters are used for both training runs. Fine-tune Llama2 separately on the original raw dataset and the cleaned dataset.

Step 4: Comparative Analysis: Quantitatively compare the human-validated categorizations with the framework\u2019s flagged instances by calculating detection metrics such as hit rate, precision, and recall. Evaluate the consistency by measuring the percentage of qualitative errors identified by the framework out of the total manually validated errors.
