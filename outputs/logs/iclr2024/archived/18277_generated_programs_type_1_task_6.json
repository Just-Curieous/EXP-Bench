    "no_answer": "After a thorough search of the repository, I could not find any scripts or code that specifically compare Zero-initialized attention with Full, PT, and PT2 fine-tuning methods for RoBERTa on SQuAD v1.1 and v2.0 benchmarks. While the repository contains code related to LLaMA-Adapter and Zero-initialized attention mechanisms, it focuses on LLaMA models rather than RoBERTa, and there are no experiments or evaluations on SQuAD benchmarks. The repository primarily contains implementations for LLaMA-Adapter V1, V2, and multimodal variants, but does not include the specific RoBERTa fine-tuning experiments described in the question."
