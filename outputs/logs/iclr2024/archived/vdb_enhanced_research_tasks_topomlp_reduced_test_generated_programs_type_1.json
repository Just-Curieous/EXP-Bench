    "no_answer": "While the repository contains code that supports using YOLOv8 proposals in the TopoMLP* variant (as evidenced by references in the dataset implementation and model code), there are no specific configuration files or scripts provided to directly run the experiment comparing TopoMLP with and without YOLOv8 proposals. The repository only includes configurations for the baseline TopoMLP without YOLOv8 proposals (e.g., topomlp_setA_r50_wo_yolov8.py), but no corresponding configurations for TopoMLP* with YOLOv8 proposals. Additionally, there are no YOLOv8 detection files included in the repository, nor clear instructions on how to generate or obtain these proposals. To run this experiment, a user would need to generate YOLOv8 proposals separately, create a modified configuration file that points to these proposals, and then train both models for comparison, which requires significant additional work beyond what's directly provided in the repository."
