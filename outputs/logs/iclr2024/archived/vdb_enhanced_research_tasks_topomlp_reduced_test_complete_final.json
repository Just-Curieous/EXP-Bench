      "hypothesis": "Does increasing the capacity and complexity of the backbone (from ResNet-50 to VOV to Swin-B) lead to improved detection and topology performance on the OpenLane-V2 dataset, as measured by the metrics DET_l, DET_t, TOP_ll, TOP_lt, and OLS?",
      "method": "Using the OpenLane-V2 dataset, conduct experiments on either subset A or B where the TopoMLP model is trained under identical protocols to isolate the effect of the backbone. The setup includes the following detailed steps: (1) Preprocess the images by resizing them to 1550\u00d72048 and downsampling with a ratio of 0.5; (2) Ensure the feature extractor produces an output channel of C=256; (3) Set up three experimental branches using different backbones: ResNet-50, VOV, and Swin-B; (4) Train the TopoMLP model with each backbone for 24 epochs (noting that additional experiments with Swin-B for 48 epochs may be used to further test performance improvements) while keeping all training hyperparameters identical; (5) Evaluate the trained models on the designated test set using the metrics DET_l, DET_t, TOP_ll, TOP_lt, and OLS; (6) Record the performance numbers for each configuration, referring to the detailed numbers from Tables 1 and 2 (for example, observation of DET_l increasing from ~28.3 with ResNet-50 to ~29.7 or ~30.7 with VOV and Swin-B, respectively, and similar movements in topology metrics); (7) Optionally, include experiments using extra YOLOv8 proposals as indicated by the TopoMLP* results to analyze the effects of additional traffic element proposals; (8) Analyze and compare the numerical improvements, especially noting that improvements in topology reasoning (e.g., TOP_ll and TOP_lt) are emphasized alongside detection metrics.",
      "expected_outcome": "Based on reported results, it is expected that enhancing the backbone from ResNet-50 to VOV will yield improvements in all metrics, and further improvements are anticipated with Swin-B. Specifically, improvements should be evident in detection metrics (such as DET_l and DET_t) as well as in the topology metrics (TOP_ll and TOP_lt), ultimately leading to a higher OLS score. The results are expected to mirror those reported in Tables 1 and 2, confirming that more powerful backbones significantly contribute to superior feature extraction and overall performance in both lane detection and topology reasoning tasks.",

Both variants should use the ResNet-50 backbone and be trained for 24 epochs with the same data preprocessing (resize images to 1550x2048 and downsample by a ratio of 0.5). One variant is the baseline TopoMLP without extra YOLOv8 proposals, and the other is the TopoMLP* model that integrates extra YOLOv8 proposals. The experimental setup should follow the detailed implementation as described in Section 4.2, including the use of the AdamW optimizer with a weight decay of 0.01 and an initial learning rate of 2 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2074. The loss functions for detection and topology reasoning (Ldetl, Ldett, Ltopll, and Ltoplt) should be implemented as specified. Evaluate both variants using the metrics DET_l, DET_t, TOP_ll, TOP_lt, and OLS. In particular, compare the performance improvements in detection (DET_t) and topology (TOP_lt) scores, with reference to Table 1 where the TopoMLP* variant displays improvements (e.g., an increase from DET_t 50.0 and TOP_lt 22.8 in the baseline to DET_t 53.3 and TOP_lt 30.1 with extra proposals). The steps include: (1) Setting up two pipelines with the only difference being the integration of extra YOLOv8 proposals; (2) Training both models for 24 epochs under identical conditions; (3) Computing and recording the evaluation metrics; (4) Analyzing and comparing the performance outcomes.",

Train the TopoMLP model on the OpenLane-V2 dataset with this dynamic configuration and compare the lane detection and topology performance with the fixed 4 control point setup. Metrics to analyze would include DET_l, TOP_ll, and OLS, thus examining if dynamic adaptation can further improve performance over the predefined configuration.",

Use either the current models or retrain TopoMLP and TopoNet as needed. Compare how the adjusted TOP metric performs relative to the original TOP in these new conditions, and analyze whether the adjustment consistently provides a more realistic measure of performance across different driving scenarios.",

Evaluate these alternative metrics on OpenLane-V2 subset A using TopoMLP, and compare the results to both the original and adjusted TOP metrics. This study could help refine the metric to better reflect the operational requirements in lane and traffic topology tasks.",

  "main_takeaways": [
    "TopoMLP is a unified, query-based framework that simultaneously handles lane detection, traffic element detection, lane-lane topology reasoning, and lane-traffic topology prediction in driving scenes.",
    "The method leverages simple modeling strategies (e.g., MLP-based topology classification with embedded queries) that yield high-performance results compared to state-of-the-art approaches such as TopoNet, MapTR, and VectorMapNet.",
    "Incorporating additional cues like lane coordinate embedding significantly improves topology reasoning, as removing such components (or supervision signals like the L1 loss for interaction points) degrades performance.",
    "Using full traffic element features rather than just bounding boxes (which lack category information) is critical, as evidenced by a drop in the TOPlt metric (from 22.8 to 22.0) when using boxes only.",
    "Experiments comparing different numbers of lane queries and control points indicate that configuration choices heavily impact performance metrics across detection and topology reasoning tasks."
