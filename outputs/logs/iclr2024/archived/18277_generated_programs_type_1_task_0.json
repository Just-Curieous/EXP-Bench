    "no_answer": "After a thorough search of the repository, I could not find any scripts or equivalent that specifically implement the GPT-4 evaluation benchmark mentioned in the experiment question. While the paper mentions GPT-4 in several places and includes comparisons between LLaMA-Adapter, Alpaca-LoRA, and fully fine-tuned Alpaca, there is no implementation of a GPT-4 evaluation benchmark that assesses the performance of these models on 80 generative tasks as described in the question. The repository contains training code for LLaMA-Adapter and evaluation code for other benchmarks (like ScienceQA), but not for the specific GPT-4 evaluation benchmark mentioned in the experiment question."
