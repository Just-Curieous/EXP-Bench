    "no_answer": "After thoroughly searching the repository, I couldn't find specific scripts that directly compare the multi-modal LLaMA-Adapter with ChatGPT_CoT and GPT-4_CoT on the ScienceQA benchmark. While the paper shows this comparison in Table 2 (page 7 of LLaMA-Adapter-arXiv.pdf) and mentions ScienceQA evaluation in several places, the repository doesn't include the evaluation scripts for this specific comparison. The repository contains code for the LLaMA-Adapter model implementation and evaluation scripts for other benchmarks (like MME), but not specifically for the ScienceQA comparison requested in the question."
