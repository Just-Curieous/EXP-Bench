    "no_answer": "After thoroughly searching through the repository, I couldn't find any scripts or equivalent that specifically answer the experiment question about comparing Zero-initialized attention to full fine-tuning, Adapter, Sidetune, and VPT methods for vision model fine-tuning with ViT on the VTAB-1K benchmark. The repository primarily focuses on LLaMA-Adapter for language models and its extension to multimodal capabilities (LLaMA-Adapter V2), but doesn't contain evaluation scripts for comparing different vision model fine-tuning methods on VTAB-1K. While the papers mention Zero-initialized attention and various fine-tuning approaches, there are no specific scripts in the repository that implement the comparison described in the experiment question."
