  "requirements": [
    "Step 1: Import necessary libraries including PyTorch, mmcv, mmdet, mmdet3d, and custom modules from the OpenLaneV2 evaluation toolkit.",
    "Step 2: Define command-line arguments for the test script, including configuration file path, checkpoint path, evaluation metrics, and configuration overrides.",
    "Step 3: Load the configuration file that defines the model architecture, dataset, and testing parameters.",
    "Step 4: Apply any configuration overrides specified in the command-line arguments using the merge_from_dict method.",
    "Step 5: Set up multi-processing settings and CUDA environment based on the configuration.",
    "Step 6: Build the dataset for testing using the OpenLaneV2SubsetADataset class, which loads data from the OpenLaneV2 dataset.",
    "Step 7: Create a data loader with appropriate batch size, workers, and distribution settings.",
    "Step 8: Build the TopoMLP model with four main components: lane head (lc_head), traffic element head (te_head), lane-to-lane topology head (lclc_head), and lane-to-traffic topology head (lcte_head).",
    "Step 9: Load the model checkpoint from the specified path and map it to the appropriate device.",
    "Step 10: Optionally fuse convolutional and batch normalization layers if specified in the arguments.",
    "Step 11: Set up the model for distributed or single-GPU testing based on the launcher argument.",
    "Step 12: Run the model inference on the test dataset to get predictions for lane centerlines, traffic elements, and their topological relationships.",
    "Step 13: Process the model outputs by filtering predictions based on confidence thresholds and transforming lane control points to lane points using Bezier curves.",
    "Step 14: Format the predictions according to the OpenLaneV2 evaluation format, including lane centerlines, traffic elements, and topology matrices.",
    "Step 15: Evaluate the predictions using the OpenLaneV2 evaluation toolkit, focusing on the TOP_lt metric for lane-traffic topology.",
    "Step 16: For the ablation study comparing traffic feature representations, run the test script three times with different configuration overrides:",
    "Step 17: For the baseline model with detailed traffic feature representation, use the default configuration without overrides.",
    "Step 18: For the variant without view transformation matrix, add the override 'model.lcte_head.add_pos=False' to disable position embedding in the lane-traffic topology head.",
    "Step 19: For the variant using only bounding box representations, add the override 'model.te_head.test_cfg.use_box_type=True' to use simplified box representations.",
    "Step 20: Compare the TOP_lt scores across the three variants to analyze the impact of different traffic feature representations on lane-traffic topology modeling."
