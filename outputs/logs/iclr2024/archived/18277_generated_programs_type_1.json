    "no_answer": "After thoroughly exploring the repository, I could not find any scripts or documentation that specifically compare Zero-initialized attention with CLIP, CoOP, CoCop, and MaPLe in vision-language fine-tuning using the CLIP model on the base-to-novel benchmark. While the repository contains code for LLaMA-Adapter which uses Zero-init Attention, there are no evaluation scripts that perform the specific comparison requested in the experiment question. The repository primarily focuses on LLaMA-Adapter implementations and evaluations on other benchmarks like MME, but not the base-to-novel benchmark comparison with the specified methods."
