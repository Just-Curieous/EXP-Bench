      "hypothesis": "Does increasing the capacity and complexity of the backbone (from ResNet-50 to VOV to Swin-B) lead to improved detection and topology performance on the OpenLane-V2 dataset, as measured by the metrics DET_l, DET_t, TOP_ll, TOP_lt, and OLS?",
      "method": "Using the OpenLane-V2 dataset, conduct experiments on either subset A or B where the TopoMLP model is trained under identical protocols to isolate the effect of the backbone. The setup includes the following detailed steps: (1) Preprocess the images by resizing them to 1550\u00d72048 and downsampling with a ratio of 0.5; (2) Ensure the feature extractor produces an output channel of C=256; (3) Set up three experimental branches using different backbones: ResNet-50, VOV, and Swin-B; (4) Train the TopoMLP model with each backbone for 24 epochs (noting that additional experiments with Swin-B for 48 epochs may be used to further test performance improvements) while keeping all training hyperparameters identical; (5) Evaluate the trained models on the designated test set using the metrics DET_l, DET_t, TOP_ll, TOP_lt, and OLS; (6) Record the performance numbers for each configuration, referring to the detailed numbers from Tables 1 and 2 (for example, observation of DET_l increasing from ~28.3 with ResNet-50 to ~29.7 or ~30.7 with VOV and Swin-B, respectively, and similar movements in topology metrics); (7) Optionally, include experiments using extra YOLOv8 proposals as indicated by the TopoMLP* results to analyze the effects of additional traffic element proposals; (8) Analyze and compare the numerical improvements, especially noting that improvements in topology reasoning (e.g., TOP_ll and TOP_lt) are emphasized alongside detection metrics.",
      "expected_outcome": "Based on reported results, it is expected that enhancing the backbone from ResNet-50 to VOV will yield improvements in all metrics, and further improvements are anticipated with Swin-B. Specifically, improvements should be evident in detection metrics (such as DET_l and DET_t) as well as in the topology metrics (TOP_ll and TOP_lt), ultimately leading to a higher OLS score. The results are expected to mirror those reported in Tables 1 and 2, confirming that more powerful backbones significantly contribute to superior feature extraction and overall performance in both lane detection and topology reasoning tasks.",

      "method": "Utilize the OpenLane-V2 dataset (subset A) and train two variants of the TopoMLP model under identical experimental conditions. Both variants should use the ResNet-50 backbone and be trained for 24 epochs with the same data preprocessing (resize images to 1550x2048 and downsample by a ratio of 0.5). One variant is the baseline TopoMLP without extra YOLOv8 proposals, and the other is the TopoMLP* model that integrates extra YOLOv8 proposals. The experimental setup should follow the detailed implementation as described in Section 4.2, including the use of the AdamW optimizer with a weight decay of 0.01 and an initial learning rate of 2 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2074. The loss functions for detection and topology reasoning (Ldetl, Ldett, Ltopll, and Ltoplt) should be implemented as specified. Evaluate both variants using the metrics DET_l, DET_t, TOP_ll, TOP_lt, and OLS. In particular, compare the performance improvements in detection (DET_t) and topology (TOP_lt) scores, with reference to Table 1 where the TopoMLP* variant displays improvements (e.g., an increase from DET_t 50.0 and TOP_lt 22.8 in the baseline to DET_t 53.3 and TOP_lt 30.1 with extra proposals). The steps include: (1) Setting up two pipelines with the only difference being the integration of extra YOLOv8 proposals; (2) Training both models for 24 epochs under identical conditions; (3) Computing and recording the evaluation metrics; (4) Analyzing and comparing the performance outcomes.",
