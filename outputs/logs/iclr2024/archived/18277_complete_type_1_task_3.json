      "method": "1. **Problem Setup:** \n    - **Task:** \n    Perform an ablation study to assess the impact of varying the number of layers (L) on model performance when inserting adaptation prompts in a LLaMA model.\n    - **Objective:** \n    Determine the effect of layer count on answering accuracy, identifying an optimal L for adaptation prompt insertion.\n\n2. **Evaluation Metrics:**\n    - Answering accuracy measured on the ScienceQA validation set.\n3. **Comparative Evaluation:**\n    - Model: LLaMA-Adapter\n        - Insertion Layers L:\n            - L = 10\n            - L = 20\n            - L = 30\n            - L = 32\n\n4. **Settings for LLaMA-Adapter**:\n    - Fine tune LLaMA-Adapter on 8 A100 GPUs for 5 epochs.\n    - Warmup epochs:2\n    - Batch size:64\n    - Learning rate: 0.009\n    - Weight decay: 0.02\n    - Utilize the pre-trained LLaMA model with 7B parameters and N = 32 transformer layers\n    - Adopt a prompt length K = 10",
      "expected_outcome": "Increasing the layer numbers introduces more parameters, but leads to a large improvement in the answering accuracy of ScienceQA's validation set. There also exists an optimal insertion number from the higher layers, since too many layers would adversely disturb the early encoding of input words. It is expected that 30 to be the optimal number of layers.",

For instance, too many insertion layers might adversely disturb early feature encoding, while too few might not sufficiently modulate high-level information.
