    "no_answer": "After thoroughly exploring the repository, I couldn't find any scripts or notebooks that specifically compare the Zero-initialized attention method with CLIP, CoOP, CoCop, and MaPLe in vision-language fine-tuning using the CLIP model on the base-to-novel benchmark. While the repository contains implementations of the Zero-initialized attention method in the LLaMA-Adapter code, it doesn't include evaluation scripts for the specific comparison mentioned in the experiment question. The repository focuses on LLaMA-Adapter implementations and evaluations on other benchmarks like MME, but not on the base-to-novel benchmark comparison with the mentioned methods."
