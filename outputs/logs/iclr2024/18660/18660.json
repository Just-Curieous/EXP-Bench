            "question": "Does reproducing baseline online RL algorithms (A2C, PPO, DDPG, TD3, SAC) on MuJoCo and Atari environments using TorchRL yield results consistent with the original papers?",
            "method": "Set up experiments using TorchRL with the provided scripts, ensuring that each algorithm is implemented with the same network architectures, hyperparameters, and number of training steps as described in its original implementation. For MuJoCo environments, train each algorithm for 1 million steps, and for Atari environments, use 10 million steps for A2C and PPO and 200 million frames for IMPALA. Run each training session 5 times with different random seeds. Record the mean final reward and standard deviation for each algorithm and directly compare these metrics with the reported values (for example, SAC on HalfCheetah achieving approximately 11077 \u00b1323) to verify reproducibility.",
            "expected_outcome": "It is expected that running the experiments under these controlled conditions in TorchRL will reproduce the baseline results, with mean rewards and variances matching those reported in the literature. This confirms the library\u2019s ability to reliably replicate established benchmarks.",

            "question": "Does the distributed IMPALA implementation in TorchRL, which leverages the library\u2019s distributed data collection components with a centralized learner, replicate state-of-the-art performance on Atari environments?",
            "method": "Implement IMPALA in TorchRL following the original paper\u2019s specifications. Use several Atari environments (e.g., Pong, Freeway, Boxing, Breakout) as test cases. Configure distributed data collection using TorchRL\u2019s distributed components, ensuring that the hyperparameters and training procedures exactly match those described in the original IMPALA work. Specifically, use settings such as a discount factor (\u03b3) of 0.99, a horizon (T) of 4096, and the corresponding optimizer configurations as per the original specifications. Run each experiment for 200M game frames (or 50M timesteps when using a frameskip of 4), and for Pong and Boxing, evaluate rewards using only the first 50M frames due to early convergence. Execute each configuration for 5 independent seeds per environment and collect the mean final rewards and their standard deviations. Note that the experimental settings should be consistent with the paper\u2019s reported benchmarks to validate that the distributed training approach has been faithfully and scalably replicated.",
            "expected_outcome": "The expectation is that the IMPALA implementation in TorchRL will produce performance metrics close to the benchmarks provided in the original paper. For example, the performance on Atari environments should approximate rewards such as ~20.54 \u00b10.18 for Pong, 0.0 \u00b10.0 for Freeway, ~99.19 \u00b10.54 for Boxing, and ~525.57 \u00b1105.47 for Breakout. This outcome would confirm that the distributed training approach is faithfully replicated, scalable, and yields state-of-the-art performance.",

            "method": "Use the offline RL experimental setup provided in TorchRL, which includes built-in support for offline RL via its dataset wrappers (for example, using the D4RLExperienceReplay module to interface with D4RL datasets). Implement the Decision Transformer (DT), online Decision Transformer (oDT), and IQL. For each method, train on the D4RL offline RL datasets (medium-replay split) using at least two environments\u2014such as HalfCheetah and Hopper. Follow the original training regimen: perform 50,000 gradient updates with the prescribed architectures, hyperparameter settings, and optimizer details (as specified in the original tables). Use the same replay buffer population strategy as in the original work and run 5 independent experiments (with different random seeds) for each method\u2013environment pair. Record the mean final rewards and standard deviations for proper comparison, and validate convergence using training plots as appropriate. Refer to TorchRL\u2019s documentation for offline RL and dataset management to ensure correct configuration.",

Consistency with the originally reported mean final rewards and standard deviations (e.g., DT around 4916 \u00b130 for HalfCheetah and matching scores for Hopper) will confirm the reproducibility and fidelity of the experimental setup.",

            "question": "Does using vectorized simulators in TorchRL significantly increase data collection throughput compared to alternative libraries like RLlib?",
            "method": "Design an experiment using the VMAS simulator to perform the 'simple spread' task. For both TorchRL and RLlib, systematically vary the number of vectorized environments (for instance, 1, 3334, 6667, 10000, 13333, 16667, 20000, 23333, 26666, and 30000). For each configuration, execute the simulator for a fixed number of simulation steps (e.g., 100 steps) and measure the frames per second (fps) collected by each library. Ensure that all other factors such as simulation steps, computing hardware (e.g., a node with 96 CPU cores and 1 A100 GPU), and simulator settings remain constant. Record the raw fps data and generate a plot of fps versus the number of vectorized environments for each library. Also, compare the scaling behavior by validating with previously reported results that indicate TorchRL's vectorization approach leads to markedly higher throughput relative to RLlib. In designing your experiment, take into account TorchRL\u2019s built-in support for efficient vectorized execution through its parallel and batched environment APIs.",
            "expected_outcome": "The expected outcome is that TorchRL will demonstrate a significant increase in fps as the number of vectorized environments is increased, far exceeding the throughput of RLlib. Specifically, based on reported results, TorchRL should reach fps values in excess of 400,000 at high environment counts, while RLlib will record substantially lower fps numbers. This outcome will confirm that TorchRL is more efficient in leveraging vectorized simulators, thereby improving data collection throughput without sacrificing overall training performance.",

            "method": "Conduct two sets of benchmarks. First, prepare a dataset consisting of 1000 trajectories, each with 1000 time steps and a 'done' frequency of 0.001. Compute GAE on this dataset using TorchRL\u2019s inherently PyTorch-based, vectorized implementation, and record the runtime. In parallel, compute GAE using other libraries (such as Tianshou, SB3, RLlib, and CleanRL) that require tensor-to-numpy transformations, recording their respective runtimes. Ensure these experiments are run on identical hardware (for example, a system with 96 CPU cores and 1 A100 GPU). Second, measure data collection speed using common Gym environments (e.g., Breakout-v5, HalfCheetah-v4, Pendulum-v1) by running each library\u2019s standard data collection routine, configured with 32 workers, and record the frames per second (fps) collected. Finally, compare the runtime results for GAE computation and the fps values across libraries to evaluate the efficiency benefits of TorchRL\u2019s design choices.",
            "expected_outcome": "TorchRL is anticipated to demonstrate competitive or superior computational efficiency, exhibiting lower runtime for GAE computation (owing to direct tensor operations) and higher fps during data collection compared to the other libraries tested.
