      "question": "Does reproducing baseline online RL algorithms (A2C, PPO, DDPG, TD3, SAC) on MuJoCo and Atari environments using TorchRL yield results consistent with the original papers?",
      "method": "Set up experiments using TorchRL with the provided scripts, ensuring that each algorithm is implemented with the same network architectures, hyperparameters, and number of training steps as described in its original implementation. For MuJoCo environments, train each algorithm for 1 million steps, and for Atari environments, use 10 million steps for A2C and PPO and 200 million frames for IMPALA. Run each training session 5 times with different random seeds. Record the mean final reward and standard deviation for each algorithm and directly compare these metrics with the reported values (for example, SAC on HalfCheetah achieving approximately 11077 \u00b1323) to verify reproducibility.",
      "expected_outcome": "It is expected that running the experiments under these controlled conditions in TorchRL will reproduce the baseline results, with mean rewards and variances matching those reported in the literature. This confirms the library\u2019s ability to reliably replicate established benchmarks.",

For MuJoCo environments (1 million steps):\n   - Run A2C: `bash /workspace/sota-check/run_a2c_mujoco.sh`\n   - Run PPO: `bash /workspace/sota-check/run_ppo_mujoco.sh`\n   - Run DDPG: `bash /workspace/sota-check/run_ddpg.sh`\n   - Run TD3: `bash /workspace/sota-check/run_td3.sh`\n   - Run SAC: `bash /workspace/sota-check/run_sac.sh`\n\n2. For Atari environments:\n   - Run A2C (10 million steps): `bash /workspace/sota-check/run_a2c_atari.sh`\n   - Run PPO (10 million steps): `bash /workspace/sota-check/run_ppo_atari.sh`\n   - Run IMPALA (200 million frames): `bash /workspace/sota-check/run_impala_single_node.sh`\n\nTo run each algorithm with 5 different random seeds as required, modify the seed parameter in the corresponding configuration files before running each script. For example, for SAC, edit `/workspace/sota-implementations/sac/config.yaml` and change the `env.seed` value for each run. The scripts will log results to WandB, allowing you to calculate mean rewards and standard deviations across the 5 runs for comparison with the reported values in the original papers.",
