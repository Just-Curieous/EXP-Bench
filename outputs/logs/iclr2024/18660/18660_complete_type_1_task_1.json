      "question": "Does the distributed IMPALA implementation in TorchRL, which leverages the library\u2019s distributed data collection components with a centralized learner, replicate state-of-the-art performance on Atari environments?",
      "method": "Implement IMPALA in TorchRL following the original paper\u2019s specifications. Use several Atari environments (e.g., Pong, Freeway, Boxing, Breakout) as test cases. Configure distributed data collection using TorchRL\u2019s distributed components, ensuring that the hyperparameters and training procedures exactly match those described in the original IMPALA work. Specifically, use settings such as a discount factor (\u03b3) of 0.99, a horizon (T) of 4096, and the corresponding optimizer configurations as per the original specifications. Run each experiment for 200M game frames (or 50M timesteps when using a frameskip of 4), and for Pong and Boxing, evaluate rewards using only the first 50M frames due to early convergence. Execute each configuration for 5 independent seeds per environment and collect the mean final rewards and their standard deviations. Note that the experimental settings should be consistent with the paper\u2019s reported benchmarks to validate that the distributed training approach has been faithfully and scalably replicated.",
      "expected_outcome": "The expectation is that the IMPALA implementation in TorchRL will produce performance metrics close to the benchmarks provided in the original paper. For example, the performance on Atari environments should approximate rewards such as ~20.54 \u00b10.18 for Pong, 0.0 \u00b10.0 for Freeway, ~99.19 \u00b10.54 for Boxing, and ~525.57 \u00b1105.47 for Breakout. This outcome would confirm that the distributed training approach is faithfully replicated, scalable, and yields state-of-the-art performance.",

      "usage_instructions": "1. Modify the config_multi_node_ray.yaml file to set the desired Atari environments (e.g., change 'env_name: PongNoFrameskip-v4' to other environments like 'FreewayNoFrameskip-v4', 'BoxingNoFrameskip-v4', or 'BreakoutNoFrameskip-v4'). 2. Make sure the 'total_frames' parameter is set to 200,000,000 in the config file (which is already the default). 3. Run the script with 'python impala_multi_node_ray.py' for each environment. 4. For Pong and Boxing, you can evaluate rewards using only the first 50M frames by setting 'total_frames: 50_000_000' in the config file. 5. To run with multiple seeds, execute the script 5 times with different random seeds by adding 'seed=X' where X is 1-5.",
