      "question": "Given TorchRL's design that leverages native PyTorch tensor operations and vectorized computations (thereby reducing or eliminating unnecessary tensor-to-numpy conversions), does TorchRL achieve superior computational efficiency in tasks such as computing Generalised Advantage Estimation (GAE) and data collection compared to other RL libraries?",
      "method": "Conduct two sets of benchmarks. First, prepare a dataset consisting of 1000 trajectories, each with 1000 time steps and a 'done' frequency of 0.001. Compute GAE on this dataset using TorchRL\u2019s inherently PyTorch-based, vectorized implementation, and record the runtime. In parallel, compute GAE using other libraries (such as Tianshou, SB3, RLlib, and CleanRL) that require tensor-to-numpy transformations, recording their respective runtimes. Ensure these experiments are run on identical hardware (for example, a system with 96 CPU cores and 1 A100 GPU). Second, measure data collection speed using common Gym environments (e.g., Breakout-v5, HalfCheetah-v4, Pendulum-v1) by running each library\u2019s standard data collection routine, configured with 32 workers, and record the frames per second (fps) collected. Finally, compare the runtime results for GAE computation and the fps values across libraries to evaluate the efficiency benefits of TorchRL\u2019s design choices.",
      "expected_outcome": "TorchRL is anticipated to demonstrate competitive or superior computational efficiency, exhibiting lower runtime for GAE computation (owing to direct tensor operations) and higher fps during data collection compared to the other libraries tested. These outcomes would validate TorchRL\u2019s design choices oriented towards high throughput.",

      "usage_instructions": "To benchmark GAE computation efficiency, run 'pytest /workspace/benchmarks/test_objectives_benchmarks.py::test_gae_speed -v' which compares TorchRL's vectorized GAE implementation (vec_generalized_advantage_estimate) with the non-vectorized version (generalized_advantage_estimate) on datasets with varying batch sizes and timesteps. To benchmark data collection speed across environments, run 'python /workspace/benchmarks/ecosystem/gym_env_throughput.py' which tests throughput on common environments including HalfCheetah-v4 and Breakout-v5 with different numbers of workers (including 32 as specified in the question). The script measures frames per second (fps) for various configurations and saves the results to text files.",
