      "question": "Does reproducing baseline online RL algorithms (A2C, PPO, DDPG, TD3, SAC) on MuJoCo and Atari environments using TorchRL yield results consistent with the original papers?",
      "method": "Set up experiments using TorchRL with the provided scripts, ensuring that each algorithm is implemented with the same network architectures, hyperparameters, and number of training steps as described in its original implementation. For MuJoCo environments, train each algorithm for 1 million steps, and for Atari environments, use 10 million steps for A2C and PPO and 200 million frames for IMPALA. Run each training session 5 times with different random seeds. Record the mean final reward and standard deviation for each algorithm and directly compare these metrics with the reported values (for example, SAC on HalfCheetah achieving approximately 11077 \u00b1323) to verify reproducibility.",
      "expected_outcome": "It is expected that running the experiments under these controlled conditions in TorchRL will reproduce the baseline results, with mean rewards and variances matching those reported in the literature.

Configure distributed data collection using TorchRL\u2019s distributed components, ensuring that the hyperparameters and training procedures exactly match those described in the original IMPALA work. Specifically, use settings such as a discount factor (\u03b3) of 0.99, a horizon (T) of 4096, and the corresponding optimizer configurations as per the original specifications. Run each experiment for 200M game frames (or 50M timesteps when using a frameskip of 4), and for Pong and Boxing, evaluate rewards using only the first 50M frames due to early convergence. Execute each configuration for 5 independent seeds per environment and collect the mean final rewards and their standard deviations. Note that the experimental settings should be consistent with the paper\u2019s reported benchmarks to validate that the distributed training approach has been faithfully and scalably replicated.",

For Decision Transformer (DT):\n   - Implement a transformer-based architecture that takes in sequences of states, actions, and returns-to-go\n   - Train the model to predict actions given states and desired returns\n   - Use a supervised learning approach with L2 loss\n   - Perform 50,000 gradient updates during training\n\n3. For Online Decision Transformer (oDT):\n   - Extend the DT architecture to support online fine-tuning\n   - Include temperature-based entropy regularization\n   - Support both pretraining on offline data and online adaptation\n   - Allow configuration of pretraining steps (default 10,000, but should support 50,000 for comparison)\n\n4. For Implicit Q-Learning (IQL):\n   - Implement actor, critic (Q-function), and value networks\n   - Train using the IQL objective with expectile regression for the value function\n   - Use temperature-scaled advantage weighting for the policy\n   - Perform 50,000 gradient updates during training\n\n5.

For both TorchRL and RLlib, systematically vary the number of vectorized environments (for instance, 1, 3334, 6667, 10000, 13333, 16667, 20000, 23333, 26666, and 30000). For each configuration, execute the simulator for a fixed number of simulation steps (e.g., 100 steps) and measure the frames per second (fps) collected by each library. Ensure that all other factors such as simulation steps, computing hardware (e.g., a node with 96 CPU cores and 1 A100 GPU), and simulator settings remain constant. Record the raw fps data and generate a plot of fps versus the number of vectorized environments for each library. Also, compare the scaling behavior by validating with previously reported results that indicate TorchRL's vectorization approach leads to markedly higher throughput relative to RLlib. In designing your experiment, take into account TorchRL\u2019s built-in support for efficient vectorized execution through its parallel and batched environment APIs.",

Specifically, based on reported results, TorchRL should reach fps values in excess of 400,000 at high environment counts, while RLlib will record substantially lower fps numbers. This outcome will confirm that TorchRL is more efficient in leveraging vectorized simulators, thereby improving data collection throughput without sacrificing overall training performance.",
