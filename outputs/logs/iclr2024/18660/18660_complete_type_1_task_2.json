      "question": "Can offline RL methods (specifically, the Decision Transformer, online Decision Transformer, and IQL) implemented in TorchRL reproduce the reported results on D4RL offline datasets by leveraging TorchRL\u2019s provided offline RL experimental framework and dataset wrappers?",
      "method": "Use the offline RL experimental setup provided in TorchRL, which includes built-in support for offline RL via its dataset wrappers (for example, using the D4RLExperienceReplay module to interface with D4RL datasets). Implement the Decision Transformer (DT), online Decision Transformer (oDT), and IQL. For each method, train on the D4RL offline RL datasets (medium-replay split) using at least two environments\u2014such as HalfCheetah and Hopper. Follow the original training regimen: perform 50,000 gradient updates with the prescribed architectures, hyperparameter settings, and optimizer details (as specified in the original tables). Use the same replay buffer population strategy as in the original work and run 5 independent experiments (with different random seeds) for each method\u2013environment pair. Record the mean final rewards and standard deviations for proper comparison, and validate convergence using training plots as appropriate. Refer to TorchRL\u2019s documentation for offline RL and dataset management to ensure correct configuration.",
      "expected_outcome": "The experiments are expected to yield results that closely match the reported numbers in Table 2, demonstrating that the TorchRL implementations of DT, oDT, and IQL can reliably reproduce the offline RL benchmarks on the D4RL datasets. Consistency with the originally reported mean final rewards and standard deviations (e.g., DT around 4916 \u00b130 for HalfCheetah and matching scores for Hopper) will confirm the reproducibility and fidelity of the experimental setup.",
