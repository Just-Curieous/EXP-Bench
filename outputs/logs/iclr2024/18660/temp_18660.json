            "question": "Does reproducing baseline online RL algorithms (A2C, PPO, DDPG, TD3, SAC) on MuJoCo and Atari environments using TorchRL yield results consistent with the original papers?",
            "method": "Set up experiments using TorchRL with the provided scripts, ensuring that each algorithm is implemented with the same network architectures, hyperparameters, and number of training steps as described in its original implementation. For MuJoCo environments, train each algorithm for 1 million steps, and for Atari environments, use 10 million steps for A2C and PPO and 200 million frames for IMPALA. Run each training session 5 times with different random seeds. Record the mean final reward and standard deviation for each algorithm. Directly compare these metrics with the reported values (for example, SAC on HalfCheetah achieving approximately 11077 \u00b1323) to verify reproducibility.",
            "expected_outcome": "It is expected that running the experiments under these controlled conditions in TorchRL will reproduce the baseline results, with mean rewards and variances matching those reported in the literature. This confirms the library\u2019s ability to reliably replicate established benchmarks.",

            "question": "Does the distributed IMPALA implementation in TorchRL, which utilizes distributed data collection with a centralized learner, replicate state-of-the-art performance on Atari environments?",
            "method": "Implement IMPALA in TorchRL following the original paper's specifications. Use several Atari environments (e.g., Pong, Freeway, Boxing, Breakout) as test cases. Configure distributed data collection using TorchRL\u2019s distributed components, ensuring that the hyperparameters and training procedures match those described in the original IMPALA work. Run each experiment for the specified number of training iterations and run 5 independent seeds per environment. Collect and report the mean final rewards and their standard deviations. Make sure to adhere to the training duration mentioned (approximately 8 hours for Atari experiments) to simulate the original training setup.",
            "expected_outcome": "The expectation is that the IMPALA implementation in TorchRL will generate performance statistics close to the benchmarks provided in the paper (for instance, rewards such as ~20.54 \u00b10.18 in some Atari scenarios), confirming that the distributed approach is faithfully replicated and scalable.",

            "method": "Use the offline RL experimental setup provided in TorchRL to implement the Decision Transformer (DT), online Decision Transformer (oDT), and IQL. For each method, train on the D4RL offline RL datasets (medium replay) on at least two environments (e.g., HalfCheetah and Hopper). Use the exact training regimen as described: 50,000 gradient updates with the prescribed architectures and hyperparameter settings. Perform 5 runs using different random seeds for each environment-method pair. Record the mean final rewards and standard deviations. Compare the obtained results with those reported (for example, DT around 4916 \u00b130 for HalfCheetah) to assess reproducibility.",

            "method": "Design an experiment using the VMAS simulator and perform the \u2018simple spread\u2019 task as follows: For TorchRL and RLlib, run benchmarks where the number of vectorized environments is systematically increased (e.g., 1, 3334, 6667, 10000, 13333, 16667, 20000, 23333, 26666, 30000). For each configuration, measure and record the frames per second (fps) collected by each library. Ensure that all other factors (such as steps run and the computing hardware) are held constant. Collect the raw fps data and generate a plot of fps versus the number of environments for each library. Analyze the scaling behavior and peak throughput.",
            "expected_outcome": "Based on the reported results, TorchRL is expected to show a substantial increase in fps as the number of vectorized environments increases, far exceeding the throughput of RLlib (for instance, TorchRL reaching over 400,000 fps at high environment counts versus RLlib\u2019s lower values). This will confirm the efficiency of TorchRL in leveraging vectorization.",

            "question": "Does TorchRL achieve superior computational efficiency in tasks such as computing Generalised Advantage Estimation (GAE) and data collection compared to other RL libraries?",
            "method": "Conduct two sets of benchmarks. First, prepare a dataset consisting of 1000 trajectories, each with 1000 time steps and a 'done' frequency of 0.001. Compute GAE on this dataset using TorchRL\u2019s inherently PyTorch-based implementation, and record the runtime. In parallel, compute GAE using other libraries (such as Tianshou, SB3, RLlib, and CleanRL) that require tensor-to-numpy transformations and record their runtimes, ensuring that the experiments are run on the same hardware (e.g., a system with 96 CPU cores and 1 A100 GPU). Second, measure data collection speed using common Gym environments (e.g., Breakout-v5, HalfCheetah-v4, Pendulum-v1) by running each library\u2019s standard data collection routine. Configure experiments to use 32 workers for each library and record the frames per second (fps) collected. Compare the timings and fps values across libraries.",
            "expected_outcome": "TorchRL is anticipated to demonstrate competitive or superior computational efficiency, exhibiting lower runtime for GAE computation (owing to direct tensor operations) and higher fps during data collection compared to the other libraries tested. These outcomes would validate TorchRL\u2019s design choices oriented towards high throughput.",
