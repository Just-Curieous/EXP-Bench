            "question": "Does reproducing baseline online RL algorithms (A2C, PPO, DDPG, TD3, SAC) on MuJoCo and Atari environments using TorchRL yield results consistent with the original papers?",
            "method": "Set up experiments using TorchRL with the provided scripts, ensuring that each algorithm is implemented with the same network architectures, hyperparameters, and number of training steps as described in its original implementation. For MuJoCo environments, train each algorithm for 1 million steps, and for Atari environments, use 10 million steps for A2C and PPO and 200 million frames for IMPALA. Run each training session 5 times with different random seeds. Record the mean final reward and standard deviation for each algorithm and directly compare these metrics with the reported values (for example, SAC on HalfCheetah achieving approximately 11077 \u00b1323) to verify reproducibility.",
            "expected_outcome": "It is expected that running the experiments under these controlled conditions in TorchRL will reproduce the baseline results, with mean rewards and variances matching those reported in the literature. This confirms the library\u2019s ability to reliably replicate established benchmarks.",

Configure distributed data collection using TorchRL\u2019s distributed components, ensuring that the hyperparameters and training procedures exactly match those described in the original IMPALA work. Specifically, use settings such as a discount factor (\u03b3) of 0.99, a horizon (T) of 4096, and the corresponding optimizer configurations as per the original specifications. Run each experiment for 200M game frames (or 50M timesteps when using a frameskip of 4), and for Pong and Boxing, evaluate rewards using only the first 50M frames due to early convergence. Execute each configuration for 5 independent seeds per environment and collect the mean final rewards and their standard deviations. Note that the experimental settings should be consistent with the paper\u2019s reported benchmarks to validate that the distributed training approach has been faithfully and scalably replicated.",

The primary contribution is the library itself, with focus on flexible algorithm development in RL, not a novel RL algorithm or model architecture. The task involves implementing a distributed RL system using the IMPALA algorithm, which is not the novel contribution of the paper. Many steps involve orchestration, such as configuring environments, setting up distributed systems, logging metrics, and evaluating models, which are non-core as they primarily use existing methods and frameworks (Ray, Hydra, etc.). Core components focus on implementing the distributed IMPALA system using TorchRL's features, including setting up the distributed collector, VTrace, A2C loss, and RMSprop optimizer, which directly relate to leveraging the library's advanced capabilities. However, these implementations are well-defined, with no ambiguity requiring external inference or guesswork."

Use the same replay buffer population strategy as in the original work and run 5 independent experiments (with different random seeds) for each method\u2013environment pair.

        "Reproducibility is a central goal, as the paper details all hyperparameters and network architecture specifics (see Tables 6\u20138 and others) to allow others to replicate the results.",
        "The study also replicates pre-training experiments for models like the Decision Transformer and IQL by directly adopting the specifications from the original implementations, underscoring the reliability of transformer-based methods in offline RL.",
        "Reported results (e.g., final reward means and standard deviations) demonstrate that careful parameter tuning and standardized experimental setups can lead to meaningful comparisons and insights into algorithmic strengths and weaknesses."
