            "question": "Will sequential integration of heterogeneous agents (starting with the L(64)P base agent and progressively adding C(384)E, L(32)S, and C(336)R agents) improve the overall detection performance of the collaborative system compared to using a single L(64)P agent? This experiment leverages an extensible framework for open heterogeneous collaborative perception that supports LiDAR, camera, and heterogeneous sensor modalities.",
            "method": "Step 1: Train a baseline collaborative perception model using only the L(64)P agent (PointPillars with a 64-channel LiDAR) on the OPV2V-H dataset. Use a grid size of [0.4m, 0.4m] for feature encoding, downsample the feature map by 2\u00d7, and process it through 3 ConvNeXt blocks to shrink the feature dimension to 64. Train for 25 epochs with the Adam optimizer, starting with a learning rate of 0.002 and reducing it by a factor of 0.1 at epoch 15. Evaluate the performance using Average Precision (AP) metrics calculated over an expanded spatial range (x from \u2212204.8m to +204.8m and y from \u2212102.4m to +102.4m).\n\nStep 2: Sequentially incorporate additional heterogeneous agents as follows. First, integrate the C(384)E agent (a camera-based sensor using Lift-Splat with EfficientNet, with images resized to a height of 384 pixels). Next, add the L(32)S agent (a LiDAR-based sensor with 32 channels that employs the SECOND backbone). Finally, integrate the C(336)R agent (a camera-based sensor using Lift-Splat with ResNet50, with images resized to a height of 336 pixels). For every new configuration, retrain the collaborative system with the same training schedule and network settings, including:\n  - Multi-scale pyramid fusion with dimensions like [64, 128, 256].\n  - ResNeXt layers with block configurations such as [3, 5, 8].\n  - Foreground estimators using a 1\u00d71 convolution modulated by hyper-parameters \u03b1\u2113 = {0.4, 0.2, 0.1} for respective levels.\n  - Depth supervision for camera-based detections to refine the feature representations.\n\nStep 3: Compare the AP metrics at multiple IoU thresholds across the baseline configuration and each sequentially enriched configuration. Additionally, document any reductions in training cost and convergence time relative to earlier multi-agent methods. This experiment follows guidelines similar to those in the HEAL framework, which provides a unified platform for integrating heterogeneous agent types.",
            "expected_outcome": "It is expected that the sequential integration of heterogeneous agents will yield incremental improvements in AP metrics across multiple IoU thresholds. Each added agent type is anticipated to contribute to a richer collaborative feature representation, thus achieving higher overall detection performance compared to using only the L(64)P agent. Moreover, the experiment should demonstrate that the proposed system not only enhances detection accuracy but also maintains lower training costs and reduced convergence times as compared with previous multi-agent collaborative perception methods.",
