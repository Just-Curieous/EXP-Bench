    "usage_instructions": "To compare LiDAR vs. Camera modalities in the HEAL framework, follow these steps:\n\n1. First, set up the experiment by creating two controlled setups as described in the paper:\n   - For LiDAR-only setup: Use the configuration files in `/workspace/opencood/hypes_yaml/opv2v/MoreModality/HEAL/stage1/m1_pyramid.yaml` (PointPillars) and `/workspace/opencood/hypes_yaml/opv2v/MoreModality/HEAL/stage1/m3_pyramid.yaml` (SECOND) which correspond to L(64) and L(32) respectively.\n   - For Camera-only setup: Use the configuration files in `/workspace/opencood/hypes_yaml/opv2v/MoreModality/HEAL/stage1/m2_pyramid.yaml` (Lift-Splat with EfficientNet) and `/workspace/opencood/hypes_yaml/opv2v/MoreModality/HEAL/stage1/m4_pyramid.yaml` (Lift-Splat with ResNet50) which correspond to C(384) and C(336) respectively.\n\n2. Run the inference script with the appropriate parameters to evaluate the performance of each setup:\n   ```\n   python opencood/tools/inference_heter_in_order.py --model_dir <path_to_model_checkpoint> --use_cav [1,2] --range 102.4,102.4\n   ```\n   - For LiDAR-only setup, use `--use_cav [1,3]` to include only LiDAR-based agents\n   - For Camera-only setup, use `--use_cav [2,4]` to include only Camera-based agents\n   - For the combined setup, use `--use_cav [1,2,3,4]` to include all modalities\n\n3. The script will automatically evaluate the performance using Average Precision (AP) metrics at different IoU thresholds (0.3, 0.5, 0.7) and output the results, allowing you to compare the performance of different sensor modalities and their complementary effects in the unified feature space."
