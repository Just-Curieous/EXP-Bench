      "question": "Will the incorporation of HEAL\u2019s Pyramid Fusion and backward alignment modules lead to substantially lower training costs (in terms of model parameters, FLOPs, and memory usage) while maintaining or improving state-of-the-art detection performance compared to baseline collaborative perception methods? (Conduct this evaluation using the OPV2V-H dataset as laid out in the HEAL framework instructions.)",
      "method": "Design an experiment in which several collaborative perception models, including Late Fusion, HM-ViT, and HEAL, are trained using the OPV2V-H dataset. Follow the HEAL framework's guidelines to set up an incremental agent integration scenario (using the provided modality assignment and configuration protocols) and ensure consistency by training with a batch size of 1 on an RTX A40 GPU. During training, record the detection performance (using AP50 and AP70 metrics) as well as training cost metrics such as model parameters (in millions), FLOPs (in tera operations), and peak memory usage (in GB). Finally, compare the training throughput and calculate the percentage reduction in computational cost metrics to assess whether HEAL achieves competitive or superior detection performance with significantly reduced resource requirements.",
      "expected_outcome": "The experiment is expected to demonstrate that HEAL not only matches or exceeds the detection performance of state-of-the-art methods but does so at a fraction of the training cost. Significant reductions in model size, computational complexity, and memory usage will be observed, confirming the efficiency benefits attributed to the Pyramid Fusion and backward alignment designs.",

      "usage_instructions": "To evaluate HEAL's Pyramid Fusion and backward alignment modules on the OPV2V-H dataset, follow these steps:\n\n1. First, train the HEAL model following the instructions in the README (sections 'HEAL's Train Command' steps 1-3).\n\n2. After training, measure the model parameters, FLOPs, and memory usage using:\n   ```\n   python opencood/tools/profiler/params_calc_multi.py --hypes_yaml /path/to/HEAL/config.yaml\n   python opencood/tools/profiler/params_flops_multi.py --hypes_yaml /path/to/HEAL/config.yaml\n   python opencood/tools/profiler/traintp_calc.py --hypes_yaml /path/to/HEAL/config.yaml\n   ```\n   These scripts will output metrics for model parameters (in millions), FLOPs (in tera operations), and peak memory usage (in GB).\n\n3. Run the same profiling scripts on baseline models (Late Fusion, HM-ViT) for comparison.\n\n4. Finally, evaluate the detection performance using:\n   ```\n   python opencood/tools/inference_heter_in_order.py --model_dir /path/to/HEAL/final_infer\n   ```\n   This will evaluate HEAL's performance in an incremental agent integration scenario using the OPV2V-H dataset, reporting AP50 and AP70 metrics.\n\n5. Compare the results to determine if HEAL achieves competitive or superior detection performance with reduced computational costs compared to baseline methods.",
