    "usage_instructions": "To evaluate HEAL's robustness under imperfect localization with Gaussian noise using the OPV2V-H dataset:\n\n1. First, ensure you have trained the HEAL model following the instructions in the README (or use a pre-trained model from the Huggingface Hub).\n\n2. Execute the following command:\n   ```\n   python opencood/tools/inference_w_noise.py --model_dir /path/to/your/HEAL/model/checkpoint --fusion_method intermediate\n   ```\n\n3. The script will automatically test the model with different levels of Gaussian noise (0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6 meters for position and 0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6 degrees for rotation) added to the agents' poses.\n\n4. Results will be saved in the model directory as 'AP030507.yaml', containing AP30, AP50, and AP70 metrics for each noise level.\n\n5. Visualizations of detection results will be saved in the 'vis_[noise_level]' subdirectory of your model directory.\n\n6. You can add the '--also_laplace' flag if you want to also test with Laplace distribution noise in addition to Gaussian noise."
