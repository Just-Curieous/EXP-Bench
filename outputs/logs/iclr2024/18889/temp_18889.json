            "question": "Will sequential integration of heterogeneous agents (starting with the L(64) P base agent and progressively adding C(384) E, L(32) S, and C(336) R agents) improve the overall detection performance of the collaborative system compared to using a single L(64) P agent?",
            "method": "Step 1: Train a baseline collaborative model using only the L(64) P agent (PointPillars with a 64-channel LiDAR) on the OPV2V-H dataset. Use the specified grid size of [0.4m, 0.4m], downsample by 2\u00d7, and process the feature map through 3 ConvNeXt blocks to shrink the feature dimension to 64. Train for 25 epochs with the Adam optimizer, starting with a learning rate of 0.002 and reducing it by a factor of 0.1 at epoch 15. Evaluate performance using Average Precision (AP) metrics over a holistically defined spatial range (x from -204.8 to +204.8 m and y from -102.4 to +102.4 m).\n\nStep 2: Sequentially incorporate additional heterogeneous agents into the system. First, add the C(384) E agent (a camera-based agent with resized images to 384px height using Lift-Splat with EfficientNet) while keeping the L(64) P agent as the base. Next, add the L(32) S agent (a LiDAR agent with 32 channels using SECOND) and finally include the C(336) R agent (a camera-based agent using Lift-Splat with ResNet50). For each configuration, retrain the system using the same training schedule and network settings (including the multi-scale pyramid fusion with dimensions [64, 128, 256], ResNeXt layers with [3,5,8] blocks, and foreground estimators with a 1\u00d71 convolution adjusted by hyper-parameter \u03b1\u2113 = {0.4, 0.2, 0.1} for levels 1, 2, and 3, respectively). Ensure depth supervision is incorporated for camera-based detections. \n\nStep 3: Compare the AP metrics (at various IoU thresholds) across the baseline and each sequentially enriched configuration. Record the detection performance improvements as new heterogeneous agents are introduced.",
            "expected_outcome": "It is expected that the sequential integration of heterogeneous agents will yield incremental improvements in the AP metrics. Each added agent type should contribute to a more robust collaborative feature representation, leading to higher overall detection performance compared to using a single L(64) P agent. The model should also demonstrate reduced training costs relative to earlier multi-agent methods.",

            "question": "Does the incorporation of different sensor modalities (LiDAR vs. Camera) in an open heterogeneous setup affect the collaborative perception performance, and do they complement each other in the unified feature space?",
            "method": "Step 1: Create two controlled experimental setups using the same training and evaluation conditions on the OPV2V-H dataset. For the first setup, use only LiDAR-based agents (L(64) P and L(32) S). For the second setup, use only Camera-based agents (C(384) E and C(336) R). Ensure that all agents in each setup are configured with their respective sensor processing pipelines and that all training conditions (grid size, downsampling, network architecture including pyramid fusion dimensions, ResNeXt blocks, and the training schedule of 25 epochs with the Adam optimizer) are kept identical.\n\nStep 2: Train both setups separately under identical conditions. Incorporate depth supervision for the camera-based agents as described, and ensure that the evaluation is performed over the same spatial range with the same AP metric criteria.\n\nStep 3: Compare the AP outcomes from both setups. Analyze whether the camera-based system, despite differences in raw detection advantages, can achieve competitive performance when isolated, and consider how the unified feature space might allow each modality to contribute unique information when combined in future studies.",
            "expected_outcome": "The outcome should reveal that while LiDAR-based agents may individually offer higher detection performance, camera-based agents\u2014when properly configured\u2014can provide complementary information that enhances the overall system\u2019s robustness. This experiment is expected to highlight that, in a collaborative setting, both sensor modalities can be balanced in the unified feature space to achieve improved holistic detection results.",

            "question": "Does the gradual incorporation of HEAL\u2019s components (multiscale pyramid feature encoding, foreground supervision, and backward alignment) lead to incremental improvements in detection performance on the OPV2V-H dataset?",
            "method": "Set up an ablation study using the OPV2V-H dataset with a fixed configuration of agent types (e.g., one L(64) LiDAR-equipped agent combined with other agents providing C(384), E+L(32), and S+C(336) inputs). First, train a baseline model without any of the HEAL-specific enhancements and record AP50 and AP70 (expected baseline AP50 \u2248 0.729). Next, add the multiscale pyramid module only and record the metrics. Then, sequentially add foreground supervision to the model with the multiscale pyramid, and finally include the backward alignment module. For each configuration, ensure the training regime (learning rate, batch size, and epochs), dataset splits, and evaluation protocols remain constant. Compare the detection performance changes\u2014specifically, note improvements such as an increase to approximately AP50 \u2248 0.894 and AP70 \u2248 0.813 when all components are present.",
            "expected_outcome": "It is expected that each component will incrementally improve the detection metrics. Starting from the baseline, the addition of each component (multiscale pyramid, then foreground supervision, and finally backward alignment) will yield a consistent improvement in performance, demonstrating that the combined effect of these innovations is crucial for achieving superior detection accuracy.",

            "method": "Design an experiment where several collaborative perception models (including Late Fusion, HM-ViT, and HEAL) are trained and evaluated using the OPV2V-H dataset under an incremental agent integration scenario. The task involves measuring not only the detection performance (via AP50 and AP70 metrics) but also training costs such as model parameters (in millions), FLOPs (in tera operations), and peak memory usage (in GB). Ensure that each model is trained with batch size 1 on an RTX A40 GPU for consistency. Compare the models\u2019 training throughput and the percentage reduction in computational cost metrics. For example, document that HEAL achieves comparable or better performance while showing reductions in parameters (e.g., \u219391.5%), FLOPs (e.g., \u219379.5%), and memory usage (e.g., \u219389.8%) compared to HM-ViT.",
            "expected_outcome": "The experiment is expected to demonstrate that HEAL not only matches or exceeds the detection performance of state-of-the-art methods but does so at a fraction of the training cost. Significant reductions in model size, computational complexity, and memory usage will be observed, confirming the efficiency benefits attributed to the Pyramid Fusion and backward alignment designs.",

            "method": "Conduct a robustness experiment using the OPV2V-H dataset where the accurate pose information of each agent is deliberately perturbed by additive Gaussian noise. The noise should be applied to both the x and y positions (sampled from N(0, \u03c3\u00b2_p)) and the yaw angle (sampled from N(0, \u03c3\u00b2_r)), with varying noise levels to simulate different degrees of localization error. Evaluate the detection performance (AP metrics) of HEAL under these noisy conditions and compare them with results from baseline models that do not incorporate specific design measures against pose errors. Record and analyze the degradation curve of AP metrics as noise variance increases.",
            "expected_outcome": "It is anticipated that HEAL will show minimal performance degradation compared to baseline methods under increasing levels of localization error. The design of HEAL is expected to yield robust fusion of features despite pose inaccuracies, thereby maintaining state-of-the-art performance even when realistic localization noise is present.",

Keep the training and network configurations consistent. Evaluate the AP metrics as the number of agents increases, and analyze at what point the performance gains reach diminishing returns.
