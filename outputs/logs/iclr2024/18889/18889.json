            "question": "Will sequential integration of heterogeneous agents (starting with the L(64)P base agent and progressively adding C(384)E, L(32)S, and C(336)R agents) improve the overall detection performance of the collaborative system compared to using a single L(64)P agent? This experiment leverages an extensible framework for open heterogeneous collaborative perception that supports LiDAR, camera, and heterogeneous sensor modalities.",
            "method": "Step 1: Train a baseline collaborative perception model using only the L(64)P agent (PointPillars with a 64-channel LiDAR) on the OPV2V-H dataset. Use a grid size of [0.4m, 0.4m] for feature encoding, downsample the feature map by 2\u00d7, and process it through 3 ConvNeXt blocks to shrink the feature dimension to 64. Train for 25 epochs with the Adam optimizer, starting with a learning rate of 0.002 and reducing it by a factor of 0.1 at epoch 15. Evaluate the performance using Average Precision (AP) metrics calculated over an expanded spatial range (x from \u2212204.8m to +204.8m and y from \u2212102.4m to +102.4m).\n\nStep 2: Sequentially incorporate additional heterogeneous agents as follows. First, integrate the C(384)E agent (a camera-based sensor using Lift-Splat with EfficientNet, with images resized to a height of 384 pixels). Next, add the L(32)S agent (a LiDAR-based sensor with 32 channels that employs the SECOND backbone). Finally, integrate the C(336)R agent (a camera-based sensor using Lift-Splat with ResNet50, with images resized to a height of 336 pixels). For every new configuration, retrain the collaborative system with the same training schedule and network settings, including:\n  - Multi-scale pyramid fusion with dimensions like [64, 128, 256].\n  - ResNeXt layers with block configurations such as [3, 5, 8].\n  - Foreground estimators using a 1\u00d71 convolution modulated by hyper-parameters \u03b1\u2113 = {0.4, 0.2, 0.1} for respective levels.\n  - Depth supervision for camera-based detections to refine the feature representations.\n\nStep 3: Compare the AP metrics at multiple IoU thresholds across the baseline configuration and each sequentially enriched configuration. Additionally, document any reductions in training cost and convergence time relative to earlier multi-agent methods. This experiment follows guidelines similar to those in the HEAL framework, which provides a unified platform for integrating heterogeneous agent types.",
            "expected_outcome": "It is expected that the sequential integration of heterogeneous agents will yield incremental improvements in AP metrics across multiple IoU thresholds. Each added agent type is anticipated to contribute to a richer collaborative feature representation, thus achieving higher overall detection performance compared to using only the L(64)P agent. Moreover, the experiment should demonstrate that the proposed system not only enhances detection accuracy but also maintains lower training costs and reduced convergence times as compared with previous multi-agent collaborative perception methods.",

            "question": "Does the incorporation of different sensor modalities (LiDAR vs. Camera) in an open heterogeneous setup affect the collaborative perception performance, and do they complement each other in the unified feature space as implemented in the HEAL framework?",
            "method": "Step 1: Using the OPV2V-H dataset as provided in the HEAL repository, create two controlled experimental setups following the sensor and model configurations described. For the first setup, use only LiDAR-based agents: L(64) P with PointPillars and L(32) S with SECOND to simulate high-resolution and real-world LiDAR detection capabilities. For the second setup, use only Camera-based agents: C(384) E with Lift-Splat using EfficientNet and C(336) R with Lift-Splat using ResNet50, where camera inputs are processed at a resolution of 800x600 and enhanced with integrated depth supervision. Ensure that all agents in each setup share identical training parameters\u2014a grid size of [0.4m, 0.4m], feature maps downsampled by 2\u00d7, feature dimensions reduced to 64 using three ConvNeXt blocks, and a 25-epoch training schedule with the Adam optimizer. Finally, perform all evaluations over the same spatial range using the Average Precision (AP) metric to assess and compare performance.",
            "expected_outcome": "The experiment should reveal that LiDAR-based agents (with their 64- and 32-channel sensors) individually offer higher raw detection performance due to direct point cloud data advantage. However, the camera-based agents, when properly configured and with depth supervision, can provide complementary visual information that enhances scene understanding in a unified feature space. Ultimately, while isolated performance might initially favor LiDAR, the unified feature space shows that both sensor modalities complement each other and contribute unique information, leading to an improved overall collaborative perception system.",

(When setting up your experiment, make sure to follow the data preparation instructions provided in the repository for OPV2V-H, which is available on the Huggingface Hub, and use the fixed agent type configuration as outlined in the guidelines.)",
            "method": "Set up an ablation study using the OPV2V-H dataset with a fixed configuration of agent types (for example, one L(64) LiDAR-equipped agent combined with other agents providing C(384), E+L(32), and S+C(336) inputs). First, train a baseline model without any of the HEAL-specific enhancements and record AP50 and AP70 (with an expected baseline AP50 around 0.729). Next, add the multiscale pyramid module only and record the metrics. Then, sequentially add foreground supervision to the model with the multiscale pyramid, and finally include the backward alignment module. Ensure that throughout each configuration, the training regime (learning rate, batch size, epochs), dataset splits, and evaluation protocols remain constant. Finally, compare the detection performance changes to determine if each component contributes to incremental improvements.",
            "expected_outcome": "It is expected that each component will incrementally improve the detection metrics. Starting from the baseline, the addition of each component (multiscale pyramid, then foreground supervision, and finally backward alignment) will yield a consistent improvement in performance, demonstrating that the combined effect of these innovations is crucial for achieving superior detection accuracy.",

(Conduct this evaluation using the OPV2V-H dataset as laid out in the HEAL framework instructions.)",
            "method": "Design an experiment in which several collaborative perception models, including Late Fusion, HM-ViT, and HEAL, are trained using the OPV2V-H dataset. Follow the HEAL framework's guidelines to set up an incremental agent integration scenario (using the provided modality assignment and configuration protocols) and ensure consistency by training with a batch size of 1 on an RTX A40 GPU. During training, record the detection performance (using AP50 and AP70 metrics) as well as training cost metrics such as model parameters (in millions), FLOPs (in tera operations), and peak memory usage (in GB). Finally, compare the training throughput and calculate the percentage reduction in computational cost metrics to assess whether HEAL achieves competitive or superior detection performance with significantly reduced resource requirements.",
            "expected_outcome": "The experiment is expected to demonstrate that HEAL not only matches or exceeds the detection performance of state-of-the-art methods but does so at a fraction of the training cost. Significant reductions in model size, computational complexity, and memory usage will be observed, confirming the efficiency benefits attributed to the Pyramid Fusion and backward alignment designs.",

            "method": "Conduct a robustness experiment using the OPV2V-H dataset. Perturb the accurate pose information of each agent by adding Gaussian noise sampled from N(0, \u03c3\u00b2_p) to the x and y positions and from N(0, \u03c3\u00b2_r) to the yaw angle. Vary the noise levels to simulate different degrees of localization error. Evaluate the detection performance using AP metrics such as AP50 and AP70 under these noisy conditions and compare the results with baseline models that lack design measures against pose errors. Provide a detailed analysis of the degradation curve of the AP metrics as the noise variance increases, and discuss how components like the multiscale feature encoding, foreground supervision, and backward alignment contribute to HEAL\u2019s robustness.",
            "expected_outcome": "It is anticipated that HEAL will exhibit minimal performance degradation relative to baseline models even as the localization error increases. Due to the design features like multiscale feature encoding, foreground supervision, and backward alignment, HEAL is expected to maintain state-of-the-art detection performance in terms of AP metrics despite the introduction of realistic Gaussian noise in the agents' poses.",
