      "question": "Does the gradual incorporation of HEAL\u2019s components (multiscale pyramid feature encoding, foreground supervision, and backward alignment) lead to incremental improvements in detection performance on the OPV2V-H dataset? (When setting up your experiment, make sure to follow the data preparation instructions provided in the repository for OPV2V-H, which is available on the Huggingface Hub, and use the fixed agent type configuration as outlined in the guidelines.)",
      "method": "Set up an ablation study using the OPV2V-H dataset with a fixed configuration of agent types (for example, one L(64) LiDAR-equipped agent combined with other agents providing C(384), E+L(32), and S+C(336) inputs). First, train a baseline model without any of the HEAL-specific enhancements and record AP50 and AP70 (with an expected baseline AP50 around 0.729). Next, add the multiscale pyramid module only and record the metrics. Then, sequentially add foreground supervision to the model with the multiscale pyramid, and finally include the backward alignment module. Ensure that throughout each configuration, the training regime (learning rate, batch size, epochs), dataset splits, and evaluation protocols remain constant. Finally, compare the detection performance changes to determine if each component contributes to incremental improvements.",
      "expected_outcome": "It is expected that each component will incrementally improve the detection metrics. Starting from the baseline, the addition of each component (multiscale pyramid, then foreground supervision, and finally backward alignment) will yield a consistent improvement in performance, demonstrating that the combined effect of these innovations is crucial for achieving superior detection accuracy.",

      "usage_instructions": "To run the ablation study on HEAL's components using the OPV2V-H dataset, follow these steps:\n\n1. First, prepare the OPV2V-H dataset by downloading it from the Huggingface Hub as mentioned in the README.md.\n\n2. For the baseline model (without any HEAL-specific enhancements):\n   - Create a configuration file by modifying `/workspace/opencood/hypes_yaml/opv2v/MoreModality/HEAL/stage1/m1_pyramid.yaml` to disable the multiscale pyramid, foreground supervision, and backward alignment components.\n   - Run: `python opencood/tools/train.py -y /path/to/baseline_config.yaml`\n   - After training, evaluate: `python opencood/tools/inference_heter_in_order.py --model_dir /path/to/trained_model_dir`\n\n3. For the model with only multiscale pyramid module:\n   - Use the existing configuration file: `/workspace/opencood/hypes_yaml/opv2v/MoreModality/HEAL/stage1/m1_pyramid.yaml`\n   - Modify the loss section to disable foreground supervision by removing or setting the pyramid weight to 0\n   - Run: `python opencood/tools/train.py -y /path/to/pyramid_only_config.yaml`\n   - After training, evaluate: `python opencood/tools/inference_heter_in_order.py --model_dir /path/to/trained_model_dir`\n\n4. For the model with multiscale pyramid and foreground supervision:\n   - Use the existing configuration file: `/workspace/opencood/hypes_yaml/opv2v/MoreModality/HEAL/stage1/m1_pyramid.yaml` with default settings\n   - Run: `python opencood/tools/train.py -y /workspace/opencood/hypes_yaml/opv2v/MoreModality/HEAL/stage1/m1_pyramid.yaml`\n   - After training, evaluate: `python opencood/tools/inference_heter_in_order.py --model_dir /path/to/trained_model_dir`\n\n5. For the complete HEAL model (with backward alignment):\n   - First train the collaboration base with multiscale pyramid and foreground supervision:\n     `python opencood/tools/train.py -y /workspace/opencood/hypes_yaml/opv2v/MoreModality/HEAL/stage1/m1_pyramid.yaml`\n   - Then train the other agent types (m2, m3, m4) using the stage2 configs:\n     `python opencood/tools/train.py -y /workspace/opencood/hypes_yaml/opv2v/MoreModality/HEAL/stage2/m2_single_pyramid.yaml`\n     `python opencood/tools/train.py -y /workspace/opencood/hypes_yaml/opv2v/MoreModality/HEAL/stage2/m3_single_pyramid.yaml`\n     `python opencood/tools/train.py -y /workspace/opencood/hypes_yaml/opv2v/MoreModality/HEAL/stage2/m4_single_pyramid.yaml`\n   - Merge the models using heal_tools.py:\n     `python opencood/tools/heal_tools.py merge_final /path/to/m2_model /path/to/m3_model /path/to/m4_model /path/to/m1_model /path/to/output_dir`\n   - Evaluate the final model:\n     `python opencood/tools/inference_heter_in_order.py --model_dir /path/to/output_dir`\n\nFor each step, make sure to use the same fixed agent type configuration (e.g., one L(64) LiDAR-equipped agent combined with other agents providing C(384), E+L(32), and S+C(336) inputs) as specified in the OPV2V-H dataset. The AP50 and AP70 metrics will be reported after each evaluation run.",
