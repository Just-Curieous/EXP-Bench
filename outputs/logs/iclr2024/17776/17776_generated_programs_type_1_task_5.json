    "no_answer": "After thoroughly examining the repository, I could not find any scripts that implement the experiment comparing UniXcoder-based retrieval methods (UniXcoder-H2L and UniXcoder-L2H) with random retrieval as described in the question. The repository contains code for the RepoBench benchmark, including scripts for running experiments (run.py) and evaluating results (eval.py) with metrics like EM, Edit Similarity, and CodeBLEU. However, there are no implementations of the specific semantic similarity retrieval methods using UniXcoder variants mentioned in the experiment question. The repository has code for different settings ('cross_file_first', 'cross_file_random', 'in_file'), but these don't correspond to the retrieval methods described in the experiment question."
