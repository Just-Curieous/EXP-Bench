      "hypothesis": "Will semantic retrieval methods (particularly InstructOR and UniXcoder) significantly outperform both lexical retrieval (Jaccard and Edit Similarity) and random retrieval in identifying the most relevant code snippets for next-line prediction?",
      "method": "Using the RepoBench-R dataset with down-sampled data to ensure parity between Java and Python (as detailed in Table 1), implement and compare three retrieval strategies: (a) Random Retrieval (execute 100 runs and average results), (b) Lexical Retrieval using Jaccard and Edit Similarity, and (c) Semantic Retrieval using encoder models such as InstructOR, UniXcoder, CodeBERT, among others. For each experiment, crop the last 3 lines (m = 3) from the in-file code context to form C[-m:] and compute similarity scores at the token level (using cosine similarity for semantic methods). Extend the evaluation by considering datasets with varied candidate statistics (e.g., Python Hard with ~17.8 candidates and Java Hard with ~25.5 candidates) and across related tasks (RepoBench-C and RepoBench-P). Use evaluation metrics including Exact Match, Edit Similarity, and CodeBLEU, and perform statistical significance testing to rigorously compare performance differences.",
      "expected_outcome": "It is expected that InstructOR will consistently outperform the other models due to its superior semantic encoding capabilities, with UniXcoder achieving competitive performance despite having fewer parameters. Lexical methods (especially using Jaccard similarity) are anticipated to serve as a strong baseline, whereas random retrieval is expected to produce the lowest performance. Furthermore, evaluations across different languages and task difficulties should reinforce the robustness of semantic retrieval methods.",
