      "hypothesis": "Does each module (DPAM T1, object-agnostic text prompts T2, text prompt tuning T3, and multi-layer visual features T4) contribute significantly to the anomaly detection performance in AnomalyCLIP? In particular, does the inclusion of each module produce a measurable improvement on both pixel-level and image-level AUROC metrics on the MVTec AD and VisA datasets?",
      "method": "Conduct a thorough ablation study using the AnomalyCLIP framework on the MVTec AD and VisA datasets. Start with a base model and then sequentially integrate each module as follows: (1) Add DPAM (T1) to enhance local visual semantics and record pixel-level and image-level AUROC; (2) Incorporate object-agnostic text prompts (T2) and measure the improvements, reflecting its significant impact (e.g., removal of T2 causes pixel-level AUROC to drop from approximately 91.1% to 84.3% and image-level AUROC from 91.5% to 65.6% as reported in Table 7); (3) Add text prompt tuning (T3) and compare the results (noting a modest improvement over the baseline, e.g., a decline from 91.1% to 90.6% pixel-level when removed); (4) Integrate multi-layer visual features (T4) to incorporate multi-scale local details, then measure the corresponding metrics (with its removal lowering pixel-level AUROC from 91.1% to around 90.0%). Keep all other training procedures and evaluation protocols constant to specifically isolate the effect of each module. Refer to the detailed performance numbers and trends in Table 7 for a quantitative comparison of each configuration.",
      "expected_outcome": "It is expected that each module will contribute to enhanced performance. Specifically, the inclusion of DPAM should improve segmentation via better local visual semantics. Object-agnostic text prompts (T2) are anticipated to produce dramatic performance gains (with significant drops in both pixel-level and image-level AUROC when omitted). Text prompt tuning (T3) is expected to yield modest but consistent improvements by refining the textual feature space, and the integration of multi-layer visual features (T4) should further boost performance by capturing additional local details. These incremental gains should align with the improvements presented in Table 7 and the ablation analysis from the paper.",

      "usage_instructions": "To conduct the ablation study on AnomalyCLIP, you need to modify the train.py and test.py scripts to disable specific modules one at a time. Here's how to test each module's contribution:\n\n1. For DPAM (T1): Modify the DPAM_layer parameter in train.py and test.py from 20 (default) to 1 to disable DPAM. In train.py line 73 and test.py line 90, change 'DPAM_layer = 20' to 'DPAM_layer = 1'.\n\n2. For object-agnostic text prompts (T2): In prompt_ensemble.py, the object-agnostic prompts are controlled by the n_ctx parameter. Set '--n_ctx 0' when running train.sh and test.sh to disable this module.\n\n3. For text prompt tuning (T3): Set '--t_n_ctx 0' when running train.sh and test.sh to disable the text prompt tuning module.\n\n4. For multi-layer visual features (T4): Change '--features_list 24' to use only the final layer instead of multiple layers [6, 12, 18, 24] in both train.sh and test.sh.\n\nFor each configuration, train the model on MVTec AD or VisA dataset using train.sh (with the modified parameters), then evaluate using test.sh (with the same modified parameters) on both datasets. Compare the pixel-level and image-level AUROC metrics from the results to quantify each module's contribution.",
