For each dataset, compute image-level metrics (AUROC and AP) and pixel-level metrics (AUROC and PRO/AUPRO). Use the same standardized experimental setup (pre-processing details, backbone, frozen CLIP parameters, etc.) as described in the paper. Compare the performance of AnomalyCLIP with that of all five competing methods and analyze the performance superiority in both anomaly detection and segmentation tasks.",

The study should compare four different configurations of context optimization: (1) no context optimization, (2) only global context optimization, (3) only local context optimization, and (4) both local and global context optimization.\n\nYour implementation should:\n\n1. Create a training script that can train the AnomalyCLIP model with configurable context optimization settings:\n   - Global context optimization should focus on image-level features and classification\n   - Local context optimization should focus on pixel-level features and segmentation\n   - The script should accept command-line arguments to enable/disable each type of optimization\n   - Save checkpoints for each configuration with appropriate naming\n\n2. Create an evaluation script that:\n   - Loads trained models and evaluates them on test data\n   - Calculates both pixel-level metrics (AUROC, AUPRO) and image-level metrics (AUROC, AP)\n   - Outputs a formatted table with results for each object class and the mean across classes\n\n3. Create a shell script that orchestrates the entire study:\n   - Runs training for all four configurations on both MVTec AD and VisA datasets\n   - Evaluates each trained model\n   - Organizes results in a structured directory\n\nThe goal is to determine whether combining local and global context optimization yields better anomaly detection performance than using only one context mode or none at all.",

Network and DPAM Integration: Apply the DPAM module starting from the 6th layer of the visual encoder. For each variant, substitute the DPAM self-attention mechanism accordingly (i.e., V-V, Q-Q, or K-K).\n\n3.

Train for 15 epochs using PyTorch-2.0.0 on a single NVIDIA RTX 3090 24GB GPU. During testing, apply a Gaussian filter (\u03c3 = 4) to smooth the anomaly score map.\n\n4.

The Q-Q variant should achieve comparable segmentation performance but may underperform in image-level detection, while the K-K variant is anticipated to excel in anomaly classification on the image level but might lag slightly in segmentation performance.

Non-core components include data handling, training setup, evaluation, and reporting, which are standard experimental procedures and do not require implementing the novel method. However, some aspects, such as how exactly to integrate the DPAM module starting from the 6th layer, and the exact details of the experimental setup in Section 4.3 and Figure 6, are not entirely clear from the description and require some inference, making them ambiguous.
