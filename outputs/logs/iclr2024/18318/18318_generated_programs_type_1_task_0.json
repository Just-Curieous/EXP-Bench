    "usage_instructions": "1. First, ensure all required datasets are downloaded and properly organized as described in the README.md (industrial datasets like MVTec AD, VisA, MPDD, BTAD, SDD, TextureDAGM, DTD-Synthetic and medical datasets like BrainHeadCT, BrainMRI, Br35H, Chest COVID-19, ISIC, ColonCVC-ClinicDB, Kvasir, Endo, TN3K).\n2. For each dataset, run the appropriate script in the generate_dataset_json directory to create the required meta.json file (e.g., 'python generate_dataset_json/mvtec.py' for MVTec AD).\n3. Modify the test.sh script to include all datasets you want to evaluate by adding additional test commands for each dataset. For each dataset, update the '--dataset' parameter to match the dataset name and '--data_path' to point to the dataset location.\n4. Run 'bash test.sh' to evaluate AnomalyCLIP against competing methods (CLIP, CLIP-AC, WinCLIP, V AND, and CoOp) on all datasets. The script will compute both image-level metrics (AUROC and AP) and pixel-level metrics (AUROC and PRO/AUPRO) as specified in the '--metrics' parameter (default is 'image-pixel-level').\n5. Results will be saved in the directory specified by '--save_path' parameter."
