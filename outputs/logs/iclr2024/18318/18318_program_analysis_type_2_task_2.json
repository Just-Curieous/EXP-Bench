    "Step 1: Import necessary libraries for image processing, visualization, and statistical analysis (/workspace/test_one_example.py:1-11, /workspace/visualization.py:1-4)",

  "agent_instructions": "Your task is to extend AnomalyCLIP to perform batch processing of multiple images from different domains (industrial and medical) and evaluate which domain the model performs better on based on anomaly detection metrics.\n\nYou need to create two scripts:\n\n1. A script for batch anomaly detection that:\n   - Loads the pre-trained AnomalyCLIP model with the provided checkpoint\n   - Processes multiple images from both industrial domain (e.g., hazelnut, capsule) and medical domain (e.g., brain, skin)\n   - Generates anomaly maps and scores for each image\n   - Saves the anomaly maps as visualizations\n\n2. A script for comparative analysis that:\n   - Groups the results by domain (industrial vs. medical)\n   - Calculates domain-specific metrics (average anomaly scores)\n   - Creates visualizations showing the anomaly maps for all processed images, organized by domain\n   - Generates comparative visualizations (e.g., box plots or bar charts) showing the distribution of anomaly scores across domains\n   - Performs statistical analysis to determine if there's a significant difference in performance between domains\n   - Outputs a conclusion about which domain the model performs better on\n\nThe existing codebase includes:\n- AnomalyCLIP_lib: A library containing the AnomalyCLIP model implementation\n- utils.py: Utility functions for image transformation and normalization\n- prompt_ensemble.py: Functions for prompt engineering with the model\n- visualization.py: Functions for visualizing anomaly maps\n\nSample images are available in the assets directory for both industrial (hazelnut.png, capsule.png) and medical (brain.png, skin.png) domains.\n\nYour implementation should follow the general approach of the existing test_one_example.py script but extend it to handle multiple images and perform comparative analysis between domains."
