            "hypothesis": "AnomalyCLIP with object-agnostic prompt learning outperforms competing methods in zero-shot anomaly detection across industrial and medical image datasets.",
            "method": "Design an experiment where AnomalyCLIP and the competing methods (CLIP, CLIP-AC, WinCLIP, V AND, and CoOp) are evaluated on a set of industrial inspection datasets (such as MVTec AD, VisA, MPDD, BTAD, SDD, TextureDAGM, DTD-Synthetic) and medical imaging datasets (e.g., BrainHeadCT, BrainMRI, Br35H, Chest COVID-19 for classification; ISIC, ColonCVC-ClinicDB, Kvasir, Endo, TN3K for segmentation). For each dataset, compute image-level metrics (AUROC and AP) and pixel-level metrics (AUROC and PRO/AUPRO). Use the same standardized experimental setup (pre-processing details, backbone, frozen CLIP parameters, etc.) as described in the paper. Compare the performance of AnomalyCLIP with that of all five competing methods and analyze the performance superiority in both anomaly detection and segmentation tasks.",
            "expected_outcome": "AnomalyCLIP is expected to achieve higher AUROC and AP (for image-level) and higher AUROC and PRO/AUPRO (for pixel-level) compared to the competing methods on most datasets. This would confirm its superior performance across diverse industrial and medical domains due to its effective balance of global and local context optimization through object-agnostic prompt learning.",

            "hypothesis": "Fine-tuning the prompt learning on an auxiliary medical dataset improves the ZSAD performance on medical images compared to fine-tuning solely on industrial datasets.",
            "method": "Create an auxiliary medical dataset with both image-level and pixel-level annotations based on ColonDB as described in the paper. Fine-tune the AnomalyCLIP model (and for comparison, V AND) using this medical dataset. Keep all other hyperparameters and training protocols identical. Then evaluate the fine-tuned models on various medical image datasets (including BrainHeadCT, BrainMRI, Br35H, Chest COVID-19 for classification and ISIC, ColonCVC-ClinicDB, Kvasir, Endo, TN3K for segmentation). Record the performance improvements in terms of increased AUROC, AP, and PRO/AUPRO values. Compare these results against the baseline models fine-tuned on industrial data (MVTec AD).",
            "expected_outcome": "The models fine-tuned on the auxiliary medical dataset are expected to show a significant improvement in ZSAD performance on medical images, especially for tasks such as colon polyp detection and brain tumor detection, confirming that domain-specific auxiliary data can enhance prompt learning and overall anomaly detection performance.",

            "hypothesis": "Object-agnostic prompt learning leads to better generalization of abnormality and normality detection than object-aware prompt learning.",
            "method": "Set up a controlled experiment by implementing two variants of the AnomalyCLIP model: one with the standard object-agnostic prompt templates and one with object-aware prompt templates. Use the same training configurations and evaluate both versions on a common set of industrial datasets (for instance, MVTec AD, VisA, MPDD, BTAD, etc.) using image-level (AUROC, AP) and pixel-level (AUROC, PRO/AUPRO) metrics. Analyze the performance gain through a direct comparison, as shown in Fig. 5 of the paper, ensuring that all factors except the prompt design remain constant.",
            "expected_outcome": "The object-agnostic prompt learning variant is expected to show consistent and positive performance gains over the object-aware version, both in image-level and pixel-level anomaly detection. This would validate that removing object-specific biases helps in capturing the generic abnormality cues essential for the ZSAD task.",

            "hypothesis": "Does each module (DPAM T1, object-agnostic text prompts T2, text prompt tuning T3, and multi-layer visual features T4) contribute significantly to the anomaly detection performance in AnomalyCLIP?",
            "method": "Run ablation experiments on the MVTec AD and VisA datasets using the AnomalyCLIP framework. Start with the base model and then sequentially add each module: first add DPAM (T1) to the base and record pixel-level and image-level AUROC; then add object-agnostic text prompts (T2) and measure improvements; follow by adding text prompt tuning (T3) and finally integrate multi-layer visual features (T4). Compare the metrics with those reported in Table 4 to assess the incremental contributions of each module. Ensure that all other training procedures and evaluation protocols remain constant to isolate the effect of each module.",
            "expected_outcome": "Based on the paper, the expectation is that each module will improve performance, with T2 (object-agnostic text prompts) showing a dramatic increase. Specifically, adding T1 should enhance segmentation by incorporating local visual semantics, T2 should substantially lift both pixel-level and image-level scores, T3 should further refine the textual space in a modest way, and T4 should provide additional gains by integrating multi-scale visual details.",

            "hypothesis": "Does combining local and global context optimization in the object-agnostic prompt learning module yield better anomaly detection performance than using only one of the context modes?",
            "method": "Design an experiment by setting four configurations on the MVTec AD and VisA datasets: (1) without any context optimization (neither local nor global), (2) with only global context optimization, (3) with only local context optimization, and (4) with both local and global context optimizations active. For each configuration, run the AnomalyCLIP model and record the pixel-level and image-level AUROC scores. Follow the protocol outlined in Table 5, ensuring consistent training conditions, and analyze the results to determine the individual and combined contributions of each context optimization strategy.",
            "expected_outcome": "It is expected that the model employing both local and global context optimization will outperform configurations using a single optimization term. In particular, global optimization is anticipated to improve image-level detection while local optimization should bolster pixel-level performance. The combined strategy should yield the highest overall accuracy, reflecting the synergistic benefits of capturing both local and global anomaly semantics.",

            "hypothesis": "How do different DPAM strategies, specifically V-V self-attention versus Q-Q and K-K self-attention, affect segmentation and image-level detection performance in AnomalyCLIP?",
            "method": "Implement three variants of the DPAM component within AnomalyCLIP: one using V-V self-attention (the default), one using Q-Q self-attention, and one using K-K self-attention. Run experiments on the selected datasets (e.g., MVTec AD and VisA) and measure both segmentation performance (using metrics such as AUROC and AUPRO for segmentation) and image-level detection performance. Compare the performance outcomes of each variant following the experimental setup described in the paper and illustrated in Figure 6, ensuring that all other model configurations are identical.",
            "expected_outcome": "The V-V self-attention variant is expected to provide the best-balanced performance across both segmentation and image-level detection. The Q-Q variant should achieve comparable segmentation performance but may underperform in image-level detection, while the K-K variant is anticipated to excel in anomaly classification but lag in segmentation performance. This experiment will confirm that V-V self-attention is generally the most effective strategy within the DPAM framework.",

Train this hybrid model using the same experimental setup as the original AnomalyCLIP on industrial datasets (e.g., MVTec AD) and evaluate on both industrial and medical datasets. Compare performance metrics (image-level AUROC and AP, pixel-level AUROC and PRO/AUPRO) with the original object-agnostic model to assess if the hybrid approach further enhances overall anomaly detection and segmentation performance.",

Train or fine-tune AnomalyCLIP with and without noise augmentation in the training data. Evaluate the performance drop or resilience using standard metrics (AUROC, AP, PRO/AUPRO) and compare the robustness of the baseline model against the noise-augmented version. This analysis will provide insights into the model's real-world application capabilities and its sensitivity to environmental variations.",

Evaluate the performance of models using only global, only local, and combined context optimizations under these degraded conditions. This will help to assess how robust the local and global context mechanisms are when detecting anomalies in less-than-ideal imaging environments.",

Measure the anomaly detection performance using relevant metrics such as AUROC and AP.
