For each configuration, run the AnomalyCLIP model and record both the pixel-level and image-level AUROC scores. Follow the protocol outlined in Table 5 to ensure consistent training conditions. In addition to AUROC scores, separately log the contributions of the global and local losses to assess their individual impacts. Analyze the results to evaluate not only the overall improvements in anomaly detection performance but also to determine whether global optimization improves image-level detection and local optimization enhances pixel-level accuracy. Include comparisons to the detailed ablation study results provided in Table 7 and Figure 9, which highlight performance declines when each module is removed.",
      "expected_outcome": "It is expected that the configuration employing both local and global context optimization will yield the highest anomaly detection performance across both pixel-level and image-level metrics. Specifically, global optimization is anticipated to enhance image-level AUROC by more effectively capturing global anomaly semantics, while local optimization is expected to boost pixel-level AUROC through improved sensitivity to fine-grained, local anomalies. The combined strategy should reflect synergistic benefits, leading to the highest overall accuracy and validating the necessity of integrating both optimization strategies in the object-agnostic prompt learning module.",

      "method": "Implement three variants of the DPAM component within AnomalyCLIP: one using V-V self-attention (the default setting), one using Q-Q self-attention, and one using K-K self-attention. For each variant, keep all other model configurations identical. Follow the experimental setup as described in Section 4.3 and illustrated in Figure 6 of the paper. Specifically, use the following experimental protocol:\n\n1. Data and Datasets: Run experiments on the selected datasets, including MVTec AD and VisA.\n\n2. Network and DPAM Integration: Apply the DPAM module starting from the 6th layer of the visual encoder. For each variant, substitute the DPAM self-attention mechanism accordingly (i.e., V-V, Q-Q, or K-K).\n\n3. Training Details: Resize input images to 518 pixels, use a batch size of 8, and optimize using the Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.001. Train for 15 epochs using PyTorch-2.0.0 on a single NVIDIA RTX 3090 24GB GPU. During testing, apply a Gaussian filter (\u03c3 = 4) to smooth the anomaly score map.\n\n4. Evaluation Metrics: Measure segmentation performance using pixel-level AUROC and AUPRO, and image-level detection performance using AUROC and AP. Compare the performance of each DPAM variant while keeping other modules (e.g., object-agnostic prompt learning, textual prompt tuning, and integration of multi-scale local visual features) unchanged, as detailed in Table 7 of the paper.\n\n5. Reporting: Document the performance differences with detailed comparisons and include relevant statistics from previous ablation studies and tables where appropriate.",

The Q-Q variant should achieve comparable segmentation performance but may underperform in image-level detection, while the K-K variant is anticipated to excel in anomaly classification on the image level but might lag slightly in segmentation performance. These outcomes will confirm that the V-V self-attention strategy is generally the most effective within the DPAM framework.",

      "no_answer": "After thoroughly examining the repository, I could not find any existing scripts that specifically implement or compare the different DPAM strategies (V-V, Q-Q, and K-K self-attention) as described in the experiment question. The current implementation in AnomalyCLIP_lib/AnomalyCLIP.py only uses the V-V self-attention variant by default (lines 81-83 of the Attention class). While the repository contains training and testing scripts (train.py, test.py), there are no scripts that automatically run experiments with different DPAM variants. To conduct this experiment, one would need to modify the Attention class implementation in AnomalyCLIP.py to create each variant and then run the training and testing scripts for each variant separately."
