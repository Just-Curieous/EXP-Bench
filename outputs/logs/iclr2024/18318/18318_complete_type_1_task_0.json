      "hypothesis": "AnomalyCLIP with object-agnostic prompt learning outperforms competing methods in zero-shot anomaly detection across industrial and medical image datasets.",
      "method": "Design an experiment where AnomalyCLIP and the competing methods (CLIP, CLIP-AC, WinCLIP, V AND, and CoOp) are evaluated on a set of industrial inspection datasets (such as MVTec AD, VisA, MPDD, BTAD, SDD, TextureDAGM, DTD-Synthetic) and medical imaging datasets (e.g., BrainHeadCT, BrainMRI, Br35H, Chest COVID-19 for classification; ISIC, ColonCVC-ClinicDB, Kvasir, Endo, TN3K for segmentation). For each dataset, compute image-level metrics (AUROC and AP) and pixel-level metrics (AUROC and PRO/AUPRO). Use the same standardized experimental setup (pre-processing details, backbone, frozen CLIP parameters, etc.) as described in the paper. Compare the performance of AnomalyCLIP with that of all five competing methods and analyze the performance superiority in both anomaly detection and segmentation tasks.",
      "expected_outcome": "AnomalyCLIP is expected to achieve higher AUROC and AP (for image-level) and higher AUROC and PRO/AUPRO (for pixel-level) compared to the competing methods on most datasets. This would confirm its superior performance across diverse industrial and medical domains due to its effective balance of global and local context optimization through object-agnostic prompt learning.",

      "usage_instructions": "1. First, ensure all required datasets are downloaded and properly organized as described in the README.md (industrial datasets like MVTec AD, VisA, MPDD, BTAD, SDD, TextureDAGM, DTD-Synthetic and medical datasets like BrainHeadCT, BrainMRI, Br35H, Chest COVID-19, ISIC, ColonCVC-ClinicDB, Kvasir, Endo, TN3K).\n2. For each dataset, run the appropriate script in the generate_dataset_json directory to create the required meta.json file (e.g., 'python generate_dataset_json/mvtec.py' for MVTec AD).\n3. Modify the test.sh script to include all datasets you want to evaluate by adding additional test commands for each dataset. For each dataset, update the '--dataset' parameter to match the dataset name and '--data_path' to point to the dataset location.\n4. Run 'bash test.sh' to evaluate AnomalyCLIP against competing methods (CLIP, CLIP-AC, WinCLIP, V AND, and CoOp) on all datasets. The script will compute both image-level metrics (AUROC and AP) and pixel-level metrics (AUROC and PRO/AUPRO) as specified in the '--metrics' parameter (default is 'image-pixel-level').\n5. Results will be saved in the directory specified by '--save_path' parameter.",
