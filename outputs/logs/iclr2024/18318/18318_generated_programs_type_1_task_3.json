    "usage_instructions": "To conduct the ablation study on AnomalyCLIP, you need to modify the train.py and test.py scripts to disable specific modules one at a time. Here's how to test each module's contribution:\n\n1. For DPAM (T1): Modify the DPAM_layer parameter in train.py and test.py from 20 (default) to 1 to disable DPAM. In train.py line 73 and test.py line 90, change 'DPAM_layer = 20' to 'DPAM_layer = 1'.\n\n2. For object-agnostic text prompts (T2): In prompt_ensemble.py, the object-agnostic prompts are controlled by the n_ctx parameter. Set '--n_ctx 0' when running train.sh and test.sh to disable this module.\n\n3. For text prompt tuning (T3): Set '--t_n_ctx 0' when running train.sh and test.sh to disable the text prompt tuning module.\n\n4. For multi-layer visual features (T4): Change '--features_list 24' to use only the final layer instead of multiple layers [6, 12, 18, 24] in both train.sh and test.sh.\n\nFor each configuration, train the model on MVTec AD or VisA dataset using train.sh (with the modified parameters), then evaluate using test.sh (with the same modified parameters) on both datasets. Compare the pixel-level and image-level AUROC metrics from the results to quantify each module's contribution."
