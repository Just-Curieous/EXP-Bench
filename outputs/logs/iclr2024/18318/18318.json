            "hypothesis": "AnomalyCLIP with object-agnostic prompt learning outperforms competing methods in zero-shot anomaly detection across industrial and medical image datasets.",
            "method": "Design an experiment where AnomalyCLIP and the competing methods (CLIP, CLIP-AC, WinCLIP, V AND, and CoOp) are evaluated on a set of industrial inspection datasets (such as MVTec AD, VisA, MPDD, BTAD, SDD, TextureDAGM, DTD-Synthetic) and medical imaging datasets (e.g., BrainHeadCT, BrainMRI, Br35H, Chest COVID-19 for classification; ISIC, ColonCVC-ClinicDB, Kvasir, Endo, TN3K for segmentation). For each dataset, compute image-level metrics (AUROC and AP) and pixel-level metrics (AUROC and PRO/AUPRO). Use the same standardized experimental setup (pre-processing details, backbone, frozen CLIP parameters, etc.) as described in the paper. Compare the performance of AnomalyCLIP with that of all five competing methods and analyze the performance superiority in both anomaly detection and segmentation tasks.",
            "expected_outcome": "AnomalyCLIP is expected to achieve higher AUROC and AP (for image-level) and higher AUROC and PRO/AUPRO (for pixel-level) compared to the competing methods on most datasets. This would confirm its superior performance across diverse industrial and medical domains due to its effective balance of global and local context optimization through object-agnostic prompt learning.",

            "hypothesis": "Fine-tuning the prompt learning on an auxiliary medical dataset that includes both image-level and pixel-level annotations (constructed based on ColonDB) leads to improved ZSAD performance on medical images compared to fine-tuning solely on industrial datasets (e.g., MVTec AD).",
            "method": "Construct an auxiliary medical dataset derived from ColonDB that contains both image-level and pixel-level anomaly annotations. Fine-tune the AnomalyCLIP model, and for comparison the V AND method, using this newly created auxiliary medical dataset while keeping all other hyperparameters and training protocols identical to those reported in the paper. The experiment should evaluate the models on a range of medical imaging tasks, including classification tasks on datasets such as BrainHeadCT, BrainMRI, Br35H, and Chest COVID-19, as well as segmentation performance on datasets where pixel-level annotations are available. Performance improvements should be recorded using metrics such as AUROC, average precision (AP), and PRO/AUPRO, with reference to performance gains detailed in Table 3 of the paper and related analysis (e.g., increased AUROC from approximately 91.5 to 96.2 for image-level and improvements in segmentation metrics).",
            "expected_outcome": "It is expected that the models fine-tuned on the auxiliary medical dataset will exhibit significant improvements in ZSAD performance on medical images. The enhanced performance is anticipated to be observed in both classification and segmentation tasks, particularly for challenges like colon polyp detection and brain tumor detection, thereby confirming that domain-specific auxiliary data enhances the prompt learning's ability to detect anomalies. These improvements will be quantified by increases in AUROC, AP, and PRO/AUPRO values relative to models fine-tuned solely on industrial datasets.",

            "hypothesis": "Object-agnostic prompt learning leads to better generalization of abnormality and normality detection than object-aware prompt learning.",
            "method": "Set up a controlled experiment by implementing two variants of the AnomalyCLIP model: one with the standard object-agnostic prompt templates and one with object-aware prompt templates. Use identical training configurations and evaluate both versions on a common set of industrial datasets (e.g., MVTec AD, VisA, MPDD, BTAD) and, if possible, additional datasets (such as medical images from Brain HeadCT and BrainMRI as shown in Table 14). The evaluation should include image-level metrics (AUROC, AP) and pixel-level metrics (AUROC, PRO/AUPRO). In addition to overall performance, perform ablation studies to analyze the impact of individual components: (1) assess object ablation by blocking out object semantics (referencing Fig. 9) to determine the contribution of object-agnostic prompts; (2) analyze the effect of excluding modules such as DPAM, textual prompt tuning (T3), and multi-layer local visual semantics (T4) by comparing the corresponding performance drops (e.g., pixel-level AUROC falling from 91.1% to 84.3% and image-level AUROC from 91.5% to 65.6% in certain cases). Document and compare the similarity between text prompt embeddings and image features as indicated in related figures to reinforce the evaluation.",
            "expected_outcome": "The object-agnostic prompt learning variant is expected to exhibit consistent and significant performance gains over the object-aware version in both image-level and pixel-level anomaly detection. Specifically, an improvement in AUROC and AP metrics across datasets (e.g., from approximately 84.3% to 91.1% AUROC at the pixel level and from 65.6% to 91.5% AUROC at the image level) would validate that removing object-specific biases enables the model to capture more generic abnormality cues essential for ZSAD. Moreover, ablation studies should confirm that the inclusion of components such as DPAM, learnable textual prompt tuning, and multi-layer local visual semantics contributes to the overall performance boost.",

            "hypothesis": "Does each module (DPAM T1, object-agnostic text prompts T2, text prompt tuning T3, and multi-layer visual features T4) contribute significantly to the anomaly detection performance in AnomalyCLIP? In particular, does the inclusion of each module produce a measurable improvement on both pixel-level and image-level AUROC metrics on the MVTec AD and VisA datasets?",
            "method": "Conduct a thorough ablation study using the AnomalyCLIP framework on the MVTec AD and VisA datasets. Start with a base model and then sequentially integrate each module as follows: (1) Add DPAM (T1) to enhance local visual semantics and record pixel-level and image-level AUROC; (2) Incorporate object-agnostic text prompts (T2) and measure the improvements, reflecting its significant impact (e.g., removal of T2 causes pixel-level AUROC to drop from approximately 91.1% to 84.3% and image-level AUROC from 91.5% to 65.6% as reported in Table 7); (3) Add text prompt tuning (T3) and compare the results (noting a modest improvement over the baseline, e.g., a decline from 91.1% to 90.6% pixel-level when removed); (4) Integrate multi-layer visual features (T4) to incorporate multi-scale local details, then measure the corresponding metrics (with its removal lowering pixel-level AUROC from 91.1% to around 90.0%). Keep all other training procedures and evaluation protocols constant to specifically isolate the effect of each module. Refer to the detailed performance numbers and trends in Table 7 for a quantitative comparison of each configuration.",
            "expected_outcome": "It is expected that each module will contribute to enhanced performance. Specifically, the inclusion of DPAM should improve segmentation via better local visual semantics. Object-agnostic text prompts (T2) are anticipated to produce dramatic performance gains (with significant drops in both pixel-level and image-level AUROC when omitted). Text prompt tuning (T3) is expected to yield modest but consistent improvements by refining the textual feature space, and the integration of multi-layer visual features (T4) should further boost performance by capturing additional local details. These incremental gains should align with the improvements presented in Table 7 and the ablation analysis from the paper.",

            "hypothesis": "Does combining local and global context optimization in the object-agnostic prompt learning module yield better anomaly detection performance than using only one of the context modes?",
            "method": "Design an experiment on the MVTec AD and VisA datasets with four configurations: (1) without any context optimization (neither local nor global), (2) with only global context optimization, (3) with only local context optimization, and (4) with both local and global context optimization enabled. For each configuration, run the AnomalyCLIP model and record both the pixel-level and image-level AUROC scores. Follow the protocol outlined in Table 5 to ensure consistent training conditions. In addition to AUROC scores, separately log the contributions of the global and local losses to assess their individual impacts. Analyze the results to evaluate not only the overall improvements in anomaly detection performance but also to determine whether global optimization improves image-level detection and local optimization enhances pixel-level accuracy. Include comparisons to the detailed ablation study results provided in Table 7 and Figure 9, which highlight performance declines when each module is removed.",
            "expected_outcome": "It is expected that the configuration employing both local and global context optimization will yield the highest anomaly detection performance across both pixel-level and image-level metrics. Specifically, global optimization is anticipated to enhance image-level AUROC by more effectively capturing global anomaly semantics, while local optimization is expected to boost pixel-level AUROC through improved sensitivity to fine-grained, local anomalies. The combined strategy should reflect synergistic benefits, leading to the highest overall accuracy and validating the necessity of integrating both optimization strategies in the object-agnostic prompt learning module.",

            "hypothesis": "How do different DPAM strategies, specifically V-V self-attention versus Q-Q and K-K self-attention, affect segmentation and image-level detection performance in AnomalyCLIP?",
            "method": "Implement three variants of the DPAM component within AnomalyCLIP: one using V-V self-attention (the default setting), one using Q-Q self-attention, and one using K-K self-attention. For each variant, keep all other model configurations identical. Follow the experimental setup as described in Section 4.3 and illustrated in Figure 6 of the paper. Specifically, use the following experimental protocol:\n\n1. Data and Datasets: Run experiments on the selected datasets, including MVTec AD and VisA.\n\n2. Network and DPAM Integration: Apply the DPAM module starting from the 6th layer of the visual encoder. For each variant, substitute the DPAM self-attention mechanism accordingly (i.e., V-V, Q-Q, or K-K).\n\n3. Training Details: Resize input images to 518 pixels, use a batch size of 8, and optimize using the Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.001. Train for 15 epochs using PyTorch-2.0.0 on a single NVIDIA RTX 3090 24GB GPU. During testing, apply a Gaussian filter (\u03c3 = 4) to smooth the anomaly score map.\n\n4. Evaluation Metrics: Measure segmentation performance using pixel-level AUROC and AUPRO, and image-level detection performance using AUROC and AP. Compare the performance of each DPAM variant while keeping other modules (e.g., object-agnostic prompt learning, textual prompt tuning, and integration of multi-scale local visual features) unchanged, as detailed in Table 7 of the paper.\n\n5. Reporting: Document the performance differences with detailed comparisons and include relevant statistics from previous ablation studies and tables where appropriate.",
            "expected_outcome": "It is expected that the V-V self-attention variant will provide the best-balanced performance across both segmentation and image-level detection tasks, reflecting AUROC values similar to those reported in the paper (e.g., around 91.1% for segmentation and 91.5% for image-level detection). The Q-Q variant should achieve comparable segmentation performance but may underperform in image-level detection, while the K-K variant is anticipated to excel in anomaly classification on the image level but might lag slightly in segmentation performance. These outcomes will confirm that the V-V self-attention strategy is generally the most effective within the DPAM framework.",
