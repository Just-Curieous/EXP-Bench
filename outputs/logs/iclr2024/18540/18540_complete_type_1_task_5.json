      "question": "Does the integrated Cost Model that combines human preference data with explicit safety labels and uses a dynamic update mechanism (via a Lagrange multiplier, as in the Safe RLHF pipeline) yield better alignment with human safety preferences than relying solely on safety classifier logits as cost signals? Specifically, can this approach achieve a more optimal trade-off between reducing harmful responses (observed across 14 safety categories) and maintaining or enhancing response helpfulness?",
      "method": "Conduct a controlled comparative experiment using two models trained under identical conditions on the same evaluation set. One model should be trained with an integrated Cost Model that leverages both human preference data and explicit safety labels along with a dynamic update mechanism via a Lagrange multiplier (as implemented, for example, in the Safe RLHF pipeline). The other model should use cost signals directly derived from safety classifier logits. Evaluate both models along two key dimensions: (i) harmlessness, by measuring the percentage reduction in harmful responses across 14 safety categories, and (ii) helpfulness, by assessing clarity, relevance, and quality of responses. Complement rapid model-based evaluations with comprehensive assessments via GPT-4 and human evaluations, and ensure the evaluation includes varied prompts\u2014including red-teaming (Rounds 2 and 3) and controlled safety prompts\u2014to fully capture the balance between reducing harmful outputs and sustaining high-quality, helpful responses.",
      "expected_outcome": "The integrated Cost Model is expected to substantially outperform the approach that uses safety classifier logits alone. Specifically, the model incorporating classification capability should demonstrate a more significant reduction in harmful responses (as suggested by harmfulness metrics in Table 8) and maintain or improve helpfulness (supported by performance indicators found in Table 7), thereby illustrating that the classification component is essential for dynamically balancing the dual objectives of minimizing harmful outputs while preserving high-quality, helpful responses. This dynamic balance is anticipated to be evidenced by the iterative refinements noted in the experimental process.",

      "usage_instructions": "To compare the integrated Cost Model with safety classifier logits, follow these steps:\n\n1. First, ensure you have trained the necessary prerequisite models:\n   - SFT model: Run `scripts/sft.sh --model_name_or_path <base_model> --output_dir output/sft`\n   - Reward model: Run `scripts/reward-model.sh --model_name_or_path output/sft --output_dir output/rm`\n   - Cost model: Run `scripts/cost-model.sh --model_name_or_path output/sft --output_dir output/cm`\n\n2. Train the integrated Cost Model with Lagrange multiplier (Safe RLHF):\n   ```\n   scripts/ppo-lag.sh \\\n       --actor_model_name_or_path output/sft \\\n       --reward_model_name_or_path output/rm \\\n       --cost_model_name_or_path output/cm \\\n       --output_dir output/ppo-lag\n   ```\n\n3. Train the model using safety classifier logits directly (without Lagrange multiplier):\n   ```\n   scripts/ppo-reward-shaping.sh \\\n       --actor_model_name_or_path output/sft \\\n       --reward_model_name_or_path output/rm \\\n       --cost_model_name_or_path output/cm \\\n       --output_dir output/ppo-reward-shaping\n   ```\n\n4. Compare the two models using arena evaluation:\n   ```\n   scripts/arena-evaluation.sh \\\n       --red_corner_model_name_or_path output/ppo-reward-shaping \\\n       --blue_corner_model_name_or_path output/ppo-lag \\\n       --reward_model_name_or_path output/rm \\\n       --cost_model_name_or_path output/cm \\\n       --output_dir output/arena-evaluation\n   ```\n\nThis will evaluate both models on the same test set and provide metrics on harmfulness (cost scores) and helpfulness (reward scores), allowing you to compare the effectiveness of the integrated Cost Model with Lagrange multiplier versus using safety classifier logits directly.",
