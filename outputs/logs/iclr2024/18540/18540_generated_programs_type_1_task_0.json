    "no_answer": "While the repository contains all the necessary components for the Safe RLHF pipeline (SFT, reward model, cost model, and PPO-LAG training), there is no single script or small set of scripts that specifically implements the iterative fine-tuning process described in the experiment question. The repository provides individual scripts for each stage of the pipeline, but does not include an automated workflow for running multiple cycles with the specific dataset augmentation pattern (adding red-teaming prompts in later cycles) and evaluation metrics tracking as described in the question. A user would need to manually orchestrate these scripts in sequence for each cycle and manage the dataset inputs and evaluation metrics themselves."
