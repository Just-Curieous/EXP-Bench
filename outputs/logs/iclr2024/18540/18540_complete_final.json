            "question": "Does iterative fine-tuning using the Safe RLHF pipeline (as implemented in the open-source Beaver framework by PKU-Alignment) improve both the ranking accuracy of the unified Reward Model and the safety classification accuracy of the unified Cost Model over successive cycles? This evaluation focuses on whether the model consistently meets the target performances (ranking near 75\u201378% and safety classification at 70\u201376%) while maintaining overall helpfulness and harmlessness, as validated on safety prompts spanning 14 categories combined with additional red-teaming prompts.",
            "method": "Start with the Alpaca-7B SFT model (derived from LLaMA-7B) following the standard supervised fine-tuning procedure provided in the Safe RLHF pipeline. For three iterative cycles, perform the following: In the first cycle, use prompts sourced from open\u2010source safety-related datasets covering 14 distinct safety categories. From the second cycle onward, augment this mix by adding red-teaming attacks designed by researchers to capture unresolved safety issues. For each cycle, generate 3 to 6 responses per prompt to form preference pairs, and have these responses evaluated by crowd-workers using a detailed annotation scheme that assesses both helpfulness (clarity, relevance, quality) and harmlessness (risk-neutrality across the 14 safety categories). Use the annotated preference data to train a unified Reward Model (targeting around 75\u201378% ranking accuracy) and a unified Cost Model (targeting safety classification accuracy in the range of 70\u201376%). Finally, evaluate the refined models on a held-out evaluation dataset comprising both open-source safety prompts (omitted during training) and additional red-teaming prompts, using a combination of direct performance comparisons, rapid model-based evaluations, GPT-4 assessments, and human evaluations. This method aligns with the reproducible training techniques documented in the Beaver framework.",
            "expected_outcome": "The iterative refinement is expected to yield consistently high performance in both ranking accuracy and safety classification. Specifically, the refined unified models should demonstrate improvement or maintenance of performance metrics (with ranking accuracies near 75\u201378% for the Reward Model and safety classification accuracies in the range of 70\u201376% for the Cost Model) across successive cycles. This will validate that the Safe RLHF pipeline effectively enhances model safety without compromising the overall helpfulness and quality of responses.",

The repository provides individual scripts for each stage of the pipeline, but does not include an automated workflow for running multiple cycles with the specific dataset augmentation pattern (adding red-teaming prompts in later cycles) and evaluation metrics tracking as described in the question. A user would need to manually orchestrate these scripts in sequence for each cycle and manage the dataset inputs and evaluation metrics themselves.",

In each iteration, first generate additional data through red-teaming (starting from the second round) using prompts primarily sourced from Ganguli et al. (2022) and Ji et al. (2024b), along with a select subset of specifically crafted red-team prompts. Then, collect human-annotated preference data to jointly train a unified Reward Model and Cost Model that capture both helpfulness and harmlessness. Finally, evaluate the model responses by collecting paired comparisons to compute Elo scores (assessed by GPT-4 and human evaluators) for both dimensions and by gathering crowdworker statistics on the ratio of responses flagged as harmful. This procedure aligns with the training pipeline outlined in the Safe RLHF (Beaver) framework.",

The arena evaluation will output metrics showing both helpfulness (reward scores) and harmlessness (cost scores) for each model, allowing you to compare how these metrics improve across iterations. The GPT-4 evaluation will provide additional human-like assessment of the models' performance.\n\nThe results should show that later iterations, particularly Beaver-v3, record substantially higher Elo scores in both harmlessness and helpfulness compared to the base model, with improvements like an increase of approximately +244.91 in helpfulness (as measured by GPT-4) and a reduction in harmful response ratios from around 53.08% for the base model to about 2.45% for Beaver-v3.",

Measure the inter-rater agreement rates from both crowdworkers and researchers during a 10% quality inspection of the dataset, and quantify the differences in approval rates between the two methods. Afterwards, use the annotated data to train models using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) starting from the Alpaca-7B model (derived from the LLaMA-7B and refined via the Safe RLHF pipeline) to compare improvements\u2014specifically tracking the increase in helpfulness versus the more modest gains in harmlessness.",

In the second set, apply fixed reward shaping coefficients (specifically, 0.01, 0.5, 1, 2, 5, 10, and 100). Record detailed training curves capturing both the moving average of the cost signal and the win rates for helpfulness and harmlessness.
