            "question": "Does iterative fine-tuning using the Safe RLHF pipeline improve the ranking and safety classification performance of the unified Reward and Cost Models over successive cycles?",
            "method": "Start with the Alpaca-7B SFT model and apply the Safe RLHF pipeline for three iterative cycles. In the first cycle, use prompts derived from open-source safety-related datasets. From the second cycle onward, incorporate researcher-conducted red-teaming attacks to augment the prompt mix with unresolved safety-related and red-teaming prompts. For each cycle, generate 3 to 6 responses per prompt to form preference pairs, label these responses with crowd-workers following a detailed annotation scheme, and then train the unified Reward Model and Cost Model. Evaluate the models on an evenly balanced preference dataset by measuring ranking accuracy and safety classification accuracy. The evaluation dataset should be constructed from prompts across 14 safety categories, open-source datasets excluded from training, and a selection of red-teaming prompts. Compare the performance metrics (e.g., ranking accuracies around 75\u201378% for reward models and 70\u201376% for cost models, along with safety classification accuracies) across the three cycles.",
            "expected_outcome": "The iterative refinement is expected to yield high and consistent ranking accuracies as well as robust safety classification performance. Specifically, the results should mirror the reported metrics, demonstrating that the unified models maintain or improve performance through successive iterations, thereby validating the efficacy of the Safe RLHF approach in enhancing both model safety and quality.",

            "question": "Does the integration of a dynamically adjusted mix of prompt types\u2014including safety-unrelated, resolved safety-related, unresolved safety-related, and red-teaming prompts\u2014enhance the model\u2019s ability to generate diverse responses and improve safety evaluation outcomes?",
            "method": "Employ the Safe RLHF pipeline with an evolving prompt mix across three cycles. Begin with a set of prompts from open-source safety-related datasets in the first iteration, then introduce red-teaming prompts in subsequent iterations to cover vulnerabilities not present initially. For each set of prompts, generate multiple unique responses per prompt and form preference pairs for evaluation. Use crowd-worker annotations based on predefined helpfulness and harmlessness criteria to label the responses. Train the unified Reward and Cost Models on these preference pairs while following the detailed implementation and hyper-parameter settings provided in the appendix. Finally, evaluate the models on an independently constructed evaluation prompt dataset that spans 14 predefined safety categories, ensuring the dataset includes both standard and red-teaming prompts.",
            "expected_outcome": "It is expected that the dynamic adjustment of the prompt mix will lead to an evaluation dataset that better reflects both the helpfulness and safety dimensions of model responses. The unified Cost Model should then attain high safety classification accuracy (e.g., within the reported range of approximately 84\u201396%), and the overall evaluation metrics should confirm that including diverse and challenging prompts, such as those obtained via red-teaming, enhances the model's robustness in handling harmful or unsafe outputs.",

            "question": "Does the iterative Safe RLHF training improve both helpfulness and harmlessness of model outputs across iterations?",
            "method": "Using a base model (e.g., a reproduced Alpaca-7B), conduct three rounds of Safe RLHF training to generate models Beaver-v1, Beaver-v2, and Beaver-v3. For each iteration, use the unified Reward Model and Cost Model that were trained on preference data from all iterations to evaluate responses. Collect Elo scores for both helpfulness and harmlessness by having paired comparisons evaluated by GPT-4 and human evaluators. Additionally, gather statistics on the ratio of responses flagged as harmful from crowdworker labels. Compare the progression in numerical values such as Elo score increases (e.g., improvements over the base model) and harmful response ratios.",
            "expected_outcome": "Later iterations, particularly Beaver-v3, should record substantially higher Elo scores in both dimensions (with improvements like +244.91 in helpfulness by GPT-4 and a significant drop in harmful ratios from around 53.08% to 2.45%), demonstrating that iterative Safe RLHF enhances model alignment.",

            "question": "Does decoupling annotations for helpfulness and harmlessness improve annotation reliability and training outcomes over single-dimensional annotation?",
            "method": "Collect response data from the first round of Safe RLHF and perform two annotation procedures: one with decoupled annotations (separate ratings for helpfulness and harmlessness) and one with a single comprehensive preference. Measure the inter-rater agreement rates and the approval rates from crowdworkers and researchers during a 10% quality inspection for both methods. Use the annotated data to train models via PPO and compare the improvement in each dimension, especially focusing on how helpfulness improves versus the limited enhancement in harmlessness.",
            "expected_outcome": "Decoupled annotations should yield higher inter-rater agreement (e.g., approximately 69% for helpfulness and 66.53% for harmlessness versus about 61.65% in single-dimensional annotation) and higher approval rates, leading to better and more balanced training outcomes.",

            "question": "Does using a dynamic balancing approach with a Lagrange multiplier outperform fixed reward shaping coefficients in achieving a balance between helpfulness and harmlessness?",
            "method": "Train models using two methods for balancing the dual objectives: one employing the Safe RLHF approach that dynamically updates a Lagrange multiplier \u03bb based on average cost values, and another using fixed reward shaping coefficients (experiment with different settings: 0.01, 0.5, 1, 2, 5, 10, 100). Monitor training curves for the moving average of the cost signal and record win rates for helpfulness and harmlessness during training. Evaluate the models by comparing the trade-offs observed in the two approaches.",
            "expected_outcome": "The dynamic balancing method should exhibit a more favorable trade-off by preventing over-optimization of one objective while maintaining safety standards. The results are expected to show that moderate fixed coefficients still fall short in resolving the tension between objectives compared to the dynamic Lagrange multiplier update.",

        {
            "question": "Does the integrated Cost Model with classification capability yield better alignment with human safety preferences compared to using safety classifier logits as cost signals?",
            "method": "Set up a comparative experiment where one model is trained using the Cost Model that integrates both human preference data and safety labels (allowing dynamic updates via the Lagrange multiplier), and another model is trained using cost signals obtained directly from the logits of an external safety classifier. Evaluate both models on the same evaluation set by measuring improvements in harmlessness and helpfulness. Specifically, analyze metrics that indicate the percentage reduction in harmful responses and any degradation in performance when the classification capability is removed.",
            "expected_outcome": "The integrated Cost Model is expected to substantially outperform the approach using only classifier logits, achieving a more significant reduction in harmful responses and providing evidence that the classification component is critical in guiding the dynamic balance between helpfulness and harmlessness.",
