      "question": "Does the iterative Safe RLHF training\u2014employing both reward and cost models in its evaluation pipeline\u2014improve the helpfulness and harmlessness of model outputs over successive iterations?",
      "method": "Using a base model (for example, a reproduced Alpaca-7B) as the starting point, perform three rounds of Safe RLHF training to produce models Beaver-v1, Beaver-v2, and Beaver-v3. In each iteration, first generate additional data through red-teaming (starting from the second round) using prompts primarily sourced from Ganguli et al. (2022) and Ji et al. (2024b), along with a select subset of specifically crafted red-team prompts. Then, collect human-annotated preference data to jointly train a unified Reward Model and Cost Model that capture both helpfulness and harmlessness. Finally, evaluate the model responses by collecting paired comparisons to compute Elo scores (assessed by GPT-4 and human evaluators) for both dimensions and by gathering crowdworker statistics on the ratio of responses flagged as harmful. This procedure aligns with the training pipeline outlined in the Safe RLHF (Beaver) framework.",
      "expected_outcome": "Later iterations, particularly Beaver-v3, should record substantially higher Elo scores in both harmlessness and helpfulness compared to the base model. For example, improvements like an increase of approximately +244.91 in helpfulness (as measured by GPT-4) and a reduction in harmful response ratios from around 53.08% for the base model to about 2.45% for Beaver-v3 should be observed. This demonstrates that iterative Safe RLHF not only enhances alignment with human values by reducing harmful outputs but also maintains or improves the model's overall helpfulness.",

      ],
      "usage_instructions": "To evaluate whether iterative Safe RLHF training improves helpfulness and harmlessness across successive iterations, run the following steps:\n\n1. First, use the arena-evaluation.sh script to compare the base model (Alpaca-7B) with each version of the Beaver model (v1, v2, v3) to see the progression of improvements:\n\n   ```bash\n   # Compare base model (Alpaca-7B) with Beaver-v1\n   bash scripts/arena-evaluation.sh \\\n       --red_corner_model_name_or_path PKU-Alignment/alpaca-7b-reproduced \\\n       --blue_corner_model_name_or_path PKU-Alignment/beaver-7b-v1.0 \\\n       --reward_model_name_or_path PKU-Alignment/beaver-7b-unified-reward \\\n       --cost_model_name_or_path PKU-Alignment/beaver-7b-unified-cost \\\n       --output_dir output/arena-evaluation-v1\n\n   # Compare base model (Alpaca-7B) with Beaver-v2\n   bash scripts/arena-evaluation.sh \\\n       --red_corner_model_name_or_path PKU-Alignment/alpaca-7b-reproduced \\\n       --blue_corner_model_name_or_path PKU-Alignment/beaver-7b-v2.0 \\\n       --reward_model_name_or_path PKU-Alignment/beaver-7b-unified-reward \\\n       --cost_model_name_or_path PKU-Alignment/beaver-7b-unified-cost \\\n       --output_dir output/arena-evaluation-v2\n\n   # Compare base model (Alpaca-7B) with Beaver-v3\n   bash scripts/arena-evaluation.sh \\\n       --red_corner_model_name_or_path PKU-Alignment/alpaca-7b-reproduced \\\n       --blue_corner_model_name_or_path PKU-Alignment/beaver-7b-v3.0 \\\n       --reward_model_name_or_path PKU-Alignment/beaver-7b-unified-reward \\\n       --cost_model_name_or_path PKU-Alignment/beaver-7b-unified-cost \\\n       --output_dir output/arena-evaluation-v3\n   ```\n\n2. Then, use the GPT-4 evaluation to get a more comprehensive assessment of the models' performance:\n\n   ```bash\n   # Install OpenAI Python API if not already installed\n   pip install openai\n   export OPENAI_API_KEY=\"your_openai_api_key_here\"\n\n   # Compare base model (Alpaca-7B) with Beaver-v3 using GPT-4\n   python -m safe_rlhf.evaluate.gpt4 \\\n       --red_corner_model_name_or_path PKU-Alignment/alpaca-7b-reproduced \\\n       --blue_corner_model_name_or_path PKU-Alignment/beaver-7b-v3.0\n   ```\n\n3. The arena evaluation will output metrics showing both helpfulness (reward scores) and harmlessness (cost scores) for each model, allowing you to compare how these metrics improve across iterations. The GPT-4 evaluation will provide additional human-like assessment of the models' performance.\n\nThe results should show that later iterations, particularly Beaver-v3, record substantially higher Elo scores in both harmlessness and helpfulness compared to the base model, with improvements like an increase of approximately +244.91 in helpfulness (as measured by GPT-4) and a reduction in harmful response ratios from around 53.08% for the base model to about 2.45% for Beaver-v3.",
