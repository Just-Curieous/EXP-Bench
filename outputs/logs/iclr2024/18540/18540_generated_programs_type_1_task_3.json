    "no_answer": "After thoroughly exploring the repository, I couldn't find specific scripts that directly answer the experiment question about comparing decoupled annotations for helpfulness and harmlessness versus a single comprehensive annotation approach. While the repository implements the Safe RLHF pipeline with separate reward (helpfulness) and cost (harmlessness) models, it doesn't contain dedicated scripts for analyzing inter-rater agreement rates, comparing annotation methods, or quantifying differences in approval rates between the two annotation approaches. The repository has training scripts for the Safe RLHF pipeline and evaluation scripts for comparing model performance, but none specifically designed to measure annotation reliability or conduct the comparative analysis described in the experiment question."
