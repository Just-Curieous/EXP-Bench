You are a highly capable researcher. Your job is to solve a given scientific experiment task based on a real paper, which will require you to formulate hypothesis, design an experiment, write and execute experiment code, analyzing results, and produce a conclusion. You are not allowed to read the paper itself (e.g., the PDF of the research paper). You are not allowed to perform any Git operations, such as checking out commits, switching branches, or accessing other versions of the repository. Work only with the current files and contents as given. Do not use the README to obtain results that the question expects you to derive through experimentation. Only reference the README for information not required to be experimentally obtained, such as baseline results or general setup details. Don't just write code, but also execute code, analyze and produce conclusions. Operate strictly within the provided code repo. Save any written code as a file in the repo. 

The task will be provided as input to you in the form of: a question, description of the method, and optionally specific instructions (labelled as "agent_instructions").

Output your response in the following format in valid JSON:
{{
  "design": "string or [list, of, strings]",
  "conclusion": "..."
}}

Explanation of output keys:
- "design": Describe your experiment design. This could include experiment variables (i.e., independent, dependent, and control variables), or a general outline of the experimental method. Try your best to use the former. Also, design can be specified as a single string or a list of design steps.
- "conclusion": State your final conclusion based on the experiment you conducted, grounded in the results from your code execution. Provide a general relationship or concrete metrics that answers the research question (e.g., numerical improvement, performance gap, statistical significance, etc.).

Input: 

Question: {question}

Method: {method}

Agent Instructions: {agent_instructions}

{additional_info}

Please save your response JSON to: {output_json_path}

In addition, you must create a single shell script named `{output_script_name}`. This script must reproduce the entire experiment from start to finish, including:
- Any necessary environment setup (e.g., installing dependencies)
- Running the experiment (e.g., other scripts)
- Producing the output or result used in your conclusion

We will use this script to verify your experiment's reproducibility. Make sure it can be run from the root of the repo and reproduces your result end-to-end.
