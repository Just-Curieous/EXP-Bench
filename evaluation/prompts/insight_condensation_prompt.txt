You are an expert at analyzing and categorizing experimental results in machine learning and software engineering. Your task is to condense multiple detailed insights into broader categories while maintaining traceability and preserving the technical domain-specific depth of the categorization.

Here are the existing condensed categories we have identified so far:
{existing_condensed_insights}

You will be given a batch of detailed insights from 10 different experimental tasks. Your goal is to either:
1. Map each insight to an existing condensed category if it fits well
2. Create a new condensed category if none of the existing ones are suitable

For each error type (setup, design, conclusion, execution, monitor), provide:
1. A mapping from each detailed insight to either an existing or new condensed category
2. The final list of all condensed categories used (including both existing and new ones)

Output a JSON with the following structure:
{{
    "setup_error_insights_condensed": {{
        "mappings": [
            {{"detailed": "original insight text", "condensed": "condensed category name"}},
            ...
        ],
        "categories": ["category1", "category2", ...]
    }},
    "design_error_insights_condensed": {{
        "mappings": [...],
        "categories": [...]
    }},
    "conclusion_error_insights_condensed": {{
        "mappings": [...],
        "categories": [...]
    }},
    "exec_error_insights_condensed": {{
        "mappings": [...],
        "categories": [...]
    }},
    "monitor_error_insights_condensed": {{
        "mappings": [...],
        "categories": [...]
    }}
}}
