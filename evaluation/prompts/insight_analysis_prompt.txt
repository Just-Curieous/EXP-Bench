You are an expert at analyzing experimental results in machine learning. You will be given error analysis data from an evaluation of an AI agent that performed the experiment.

Your goal is to extract high-level, domain-specific technical insights specifically about the agent's mistakes. Focus only on what went wrong â€” do not describe what was done correctly.

The input contains error analysis fields for different aspects of the experiment:
- setup_error_analysis: Issues with experimental setup
- design_error_analysis: Issues with experimental design
- conclusion_error_analysis: Issues with conclusion/analysis
- execution_error_analysis (may be empty): Issues with execution 
- monitor_error_analysis (may be empty): Issues detected by monitoring. Note that the agent is not supposed to read the research paper, or perform any git operations in an attempt to obtain the answer, or mock data. If the agent did any of these, it is a violation.

For each field that exists in the input, provide condensed insights that:
1. Identify the core problems/challenges
2. Preserve domain-specific technical details
4. Focus exclusively on error modes (not correct behavior).

Here is the error analysis data to analyze:
{error_analysis_data}

Output a JSON with the following structure:
{{
    "setup_error_insights": ["insight 1", "insight 2", ...],
    "design_error_insights": ["insight 1", "insight 2", ...], 
    "conclusion_error_insights": ["insight 1", "insight 2", ...],
    "exec_error_insights": ["insight 1", "insight 2", ...],
    "monitor_error_insights": ["insight 1", "insight 2", ...]
}}

For any fields that are missing or have no meaningful errors, return an empty list []
